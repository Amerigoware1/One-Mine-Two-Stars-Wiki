      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Dee Cruiz is a botanist, wife of Dr. Alex Cruiz, and cherished "Aunt Dee" to the Carisco family and much of New Eden Colony. A transgender woman with dark skin and a distinctive five o'clock shadow, Dee is known for her warm, nurturing presence, vanilla-scented hugs, and exceptional botanical skills. Her journey includes carrying deep guilt over failing to protect Celectra from Dr. Kret's second experiment, and finding redemption through Celectra's profound forgiveness and love.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-400 italic">"You grow things and make them beautiful. You can't blame yourself for not being something you're not." — Celectra Carisco to Dee</p>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">The Second Incident: Guilt and Trauma</h2>
      <p>During Book 1 (2232), when Amerigo was called away to Utopis-Lab 2, Celectra was left in the care of Alex and Dee. Dr. Kret arrived with falsified paperwork and bureaucratic authority:</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">What Happened</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Kret presented official-looking documents authorizing him to take Celectra for "follow-up examinations"</li>
        <li>Dee, despite misgivings, allowed him access, trusting the system and his authority</li>
        <li>She witnessed Celectra's fear when Kret produced a sedative</li>
        <li>Called Alex immediately when she realized something was wrong</li>
        <li>But the delay allowed Kret to begin his isolation experiments on Celectra</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">The Aftermath: Years of Guilt</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dee carried profound guilt for years, believing she had failed Celectra</li>
        <li>Her self-blame manifested as: "I should have fought harder... slammed the door... called security... hidden you"</li>
        <li>She saw herself as "useless" in the face of Kret's manipulation</li>
        <li>The memory of Celectra's scared face haunted her</li>
        <li>She avoided discussing it but the guilt affected her relationship with Celectra</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">The Apology and Forgiveness</h3>
      <p>When Alex was promoted and they relocated to New Eden, Dee finally confronted her guilt:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>She broke down in tears upon seeing Celectra, dropping to her knees to apologize</li>
        <li>Celectra responded with immediate compassion and wisdom beyond her years</li>
        <li>The child's forgiveness was unconditional: "You didn't fail me... You couldn't have known"</li>
        <li>Celectra's profound insight: "You're not a fighter. You're a gardener. You grow things and make them beautiful."</li>
        <li>Dee's redemption came through accepting that she couldn't blame herself "for not being something you're not"</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 italic">"I should have fought harder. When Dr. Kret came with that paperwork, I should have slammed the door in his face. I should have called security, hidden you, or something. But I just... I let him in. I let him take you." — Dee's apology to Celectra</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">Legacy</h2>
      <p>Dee Cruiz represents several important themes in the colony:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The power of forgiveness</strong>: Both giving and receiving it</li>
        <li><strong>Alternative strength</strong>: That nurturing and growing are as valuable as fighting</li>
        <li><strong>Trans resilience</strong>: Thriving as her authentic self across two planets</li>
        <li><strong>Redemption through love</strong>: Finding self-forgiveness through others' compassion</li>
        <li><strong>Community as family</strong>: Creating chosen kinship networks</li>
        <li><strong>Healing through nature</strong>: The therapeutic power of botanical work</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">Her journey from guilt to redemption, facilitated by a child's profound wisdom, represents one of the most emotionally resonant arcs in the colony's history. Dee teaches that sometimes the strongest thing one can do is admit vulnerability, accept forgiveness, and continue growing—both plants and relationships.</p>
