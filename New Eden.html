  <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>New Eden is the first permanent settlement established on the surface of the planet orbiting the Niamh-Ciara system. Designed to house the initial wave of colonists after stasis, it remains the administrative and symbolic heart of the colony. Though small in population, its infrastructure supports interplanetary communication, governance, and early-stage terraforming efforts.</p>

  <h2 id="Layout_and_Structures">Layout and Structures</h2>
  <p>The village is a blend of old and new: modular colony units from the original Utopis ship are nestled between newer dwellings of stone, steel, and glass. These structures cluster around a central council hall, forming a tight-knit community. A fusion reactor sits west of the settlement, its containment dome visible from nearly every rooftop—a gleaming white sphere on the rust-red plain.</p>

  <h2 id="Surroundings">Surroundings</h2>
<p>New Eden is nestled in a crook of the Pison River, which runs north to south through the southern hemisphere. The settlement hugs the river’s bend, with plans to eventually bridge its waters as expansion continues. On the eastern edge, the river glitters like a ribbon of melted glass, its narrow green banks stitched with genetically modified flora—trees and shrubs engineered to survive the planet’s arid conditions. Beyond the river stretch rust-red plains, cracked and dry, shimmering in the heat. To the west, the fusion reactor’s containment dome rises like a geometric moon fallen to ground, visible from nearly every rooftop.</p>
<h2 id="Observatory">New Eden Observatory</h2>
<p>Perched on a ridge overlooking the settlement, the New Eden Observatory is a sleek dome reserved for guided observations and astronomical research. Its glass panels gleam under the binary sunset, reflecting the golden light of Niamh and the deepening pink of Ciara. The path to the dome winds through red-dust trails and scattered rocks, offering a panoramic view of the village below.</p>

<p>Access is restricted to authorized personnel and scheduled tours. Inside, a circular observation platform sits beneath a transparent roof, offering an unobstructed view of the sky. From this vantage point, visitors can witness the synchronized descent of Niamh and Ciara, followed by the rise of Chaos—a copper-hued gas giant whose swirling reds and blacks resemble a cosmic storm. The observatory is both a scientific outpost and a place of quiet awe, where colonists glimpse the vastness of their new home.</p>


  <h2 id="Cultural_Notes">Cultural Notes</h2>
  <p>New Eden is often described as both too small and too crowded—a paradox born of its intimate scale and the weight of expectation. For many colonists, it represents survival, legacy, and the beginning of a new chapter. Children like Celectra grow up surrounded by the remnants of interstellar travel and the slow emergence of planetary life, watching the settlement evolve from puzzle-piece modules into a living village.</p>
