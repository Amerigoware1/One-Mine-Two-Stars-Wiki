      <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>The Artificial Neural Interface (ANI), commonly referred to as the <strong>ANI headset</strong> or <strong>ANI rig</strong>, is a neuro-technological device developed on Ares to enable limited telepathic communication with the native Galinstanian species. It was created to serve as a technological backup and eventual successor to Celectra's unique biological bridge ability.</p>
      <p>The ANI mimics Celectra's natural "celectricity"—generating an electromagnetic field at a stable 21.7 Hz—allowing trained users to send and receive thought-impressions from the Galinstanians. Developed in response to Celectra's declining range during her pregnancy, the ANI represents a critical step toward ensuring uninterrupted human-Veln relations.</p>

      <h2 id="Design_and_Features">Design and Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Form Factor:</strong> Lightweight, adjustable headband with multiple neural contact nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Core Technology:</strong> Generates a stable, modulated EM field tuned to <strong>21.7 Hz</strong>, matching the natural frequency of Galinstanian communication and Celectra's celectricity.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Components:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Neural Transducer Array:</strong> Converts the user's focused thoughts into complex EM modulation patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Bismuth Amplification Circuit:</strong> Integrated from Celectra's necklace technology to stabilize and extend broadcast range.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Module:</strong> Provides sensory cues (haptic pulses, visual indicators) for connection stability and signal strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Broadcast (Active):</strong> Requires intense concentration to translate human thoughts into compatible EM patterns. Achieves approximately <strong>60% clarity</strong> compared to Celectra's natural ability.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2 id="Development_History">Development History</h2>
      <p>The ANI project existed in a theoretical phase for years but was accelerated into rapid prototyping following Celectra's first communion failure in mid-2247. Jaxon, leading the engineering team under project coordinator Amerigo, integrated existing research on Celectra's bismuth amplifiers and neural patterns into a functional, wearable device.</p>
      <p>The urgency of Celectra's pregnancy timeline created significant pressure, leading to the development of the <strong>Hybrid Protocol</strong>, where the ANI is used for routine communications while Celectra conserves her energy for complex negotiations.</p>

      <h2 id="Cultural_Significance">Cultural Significance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bridge Succession:</strong> The ANI is the first technology capable of partially replicating a biological ability once thought to be unique and irreplaceable.</li>
        <li><strong>Symbol of Transition:</strong> Represents the community's move from dependence on a single individual (Celectra) to a more distributed, resilient system of communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical Impact:</strong> Its deployment under the Hybrid Protocol has reduced the operational burden on Celectra, allowing her to focus on her health and pregnancy while maintaining her role in critical diplomacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations as Testament:</strong> The steep learning curve and current limitations in broadcast clarity underscore the complexity of Celectra's innate gift, fostering renewed appreciation for her years of service.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>First successfully tested by a team including Ananya, Chen Wei, Xan, and Maya in mid-2247.</li>
        <li>Formally integrated into diplomatic operations via the Council-approved Hybrid Protocol.</li>
        <li>Represents a central point of tension and dedication for Jaxon, whose drive to perfect the technology strains his personal life even as he seeks to secure Celectra's future.</li>
        <li>Featured in Chapter 10: "The Protocol Development," where its limitations and potential are formally assessed by the research team.</li>
