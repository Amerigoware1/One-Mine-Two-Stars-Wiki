      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Xara Kret (July 22, 2087 – March 20, 2122) was the wife of Dr. Douglas Kret, a prominent scientist in the Ares colony system. Little is documented about her early life or professional background, as records from the pre-colonization era are limited. She is primarily remembered through her familial connections and the impact her life and death had on her immediate family.</p>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Marriage and Family</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Married to Dr. Douglas Kret, a researcher known for his work in cognitive engineering.</li>
        <li>Their marriage is noted as a significant influence on Dr. Kret's personal motivations, often cited as a reason—or excuse—for his intense focus and sometimes controversial behavior in scientific pursuits.</li>
        <li>The couple had one daughter, Zoë Kret (later Zoë Carisco), born around 2106.</li>
        <li>Xara's role in the family appears to have been supportive, though details are sparse.</li>
        <li>Her relationship with her daughter Zoë was close, with Zoë recalling her mother fondly in later years.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Death and Aftermath</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Xara Kret passed away on March 20, 2122, at the age of 34 due to a shuttle accident.</li>
        <li>At the time of her mother's death, Zoë was 16 years old.</li>
        <li>Despite the loss occurring during Zoë's adolescence, she processed the grief in a normal, healthy manner, maintaining positive memories of her mother.</li>
        <li>Indirectly, Xara's death may have influenced Dr. Kret's obsessive research tendencies, shaping aspects of his professional legacy in fields like neuro-interface design and consciousness modeling.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Personal Life</h2>
      <p>Xara Kret's legacy endures primarily through her daughter Zoë Carisco, who became a key figure in the Ares colony as a psychologist and family member of the Carisco lineage. Zoë's reflections on her mother suggest Xara was a source of emotional stability and warmth.</p>
      <p>While not a public figure herself, Xara's presence as a supportive spouse and mother left a lasting impression on her family, influencing both her husband's driven career and her daughter's emotional resilience and career in psychology.</p>
