      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Dr. Yuki Chen is a senior physician specializing in radiation medicine and its effects on human physiology. Originally stationed on Utopis-Lab 3, she played a pivotal role in the early Carisco family history when she diagnosed Jenni Carisco's radiation-exposed twin pregnancy in 2122. After Dr. Alexander Cruiz's promotion to Chief of Medicine on Ares, Dr. Chen assumed his former position as Chief Physician of Utopis Station. In Book 3, she becomes Celectra's primary medical monitor, tracking the deterioration of her telepathic field with sobering precision.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">Book 1: The Diagnosis That Changed Everything</h2>
      <p>In 2225, Dr. Chen was the attending physician when Jenni Carisco was exposed to Niamh's coronal mass ejection aboard Utopis-Lab 3. During the post-exposure examination, she made two critical discoveries:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Twin Pregnancy:</strong> "You're carrying twins. The scan resolution wasn't high enough to detect them before, but now..."</li>
        <li><strong>Radiation Risk:</strong> An estimated 180 millisievert exposure during early embryonic development</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Compassion:</strong> Delivered the grim prognosis with clinical honesty: "Standard outcomes would be developmental defects. Microcephaly, neural tube closure problems. Often miscarriage."</li>
        <li><strong>Mitochondrial Anomaly:</strong> Noted Jenni's unusual mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme expression as a potential mitigating factor</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Her diagnosis set in motion the events that would lead to Celectra's unique mononous disomas condition and the eventual human-Galinstanian bridge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Career Progression</h2>
      <p><strong>Early Career:</strong> Trained in radiation medicine on Earth, specializing in space radiation effects on human reproduction and development.</p>
      <p><strong>Utopis-Lab 3 (2220s):</strong> Stationed as senior medical officer during the early exploration phase. Witnessed multiple radiation exposure cases from Niamh's unpredictable solar activity.</p>
      <p><strong>Transition to Utopis Station:</strong> After Dr. Alexander Cruiz was promoted to Chief of Medicine on Ares and relocated with his family, Dr. Chen was appointed as his replacement on Utopis Station.</p>
      <p><strong>Book 3 Role:</strong> Continues to serve as Chief Physician while taking on the specialized role of monitoring Celectra's telepathic field degradation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Book 3: Monitoring the Bridge</h2>
      <p>In Book 3, Dr. Chen conducts critical monitoring of Celectra's telepathic capabilities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>EM-Shielded Chamber:</strong> Uses Utopis Station's electromagnetic-shielded testing room to obtain clean measurements free from planetary interference</li>
        <li><strong>Sobering Discovery:</strong> Documents an 8% amplitude loss in Celectra's field over three years</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical Detachment:</strong> Delivers difficult news with professional precision: "Your baseline is deteriorating... increased noise in the modulation patterns—like static interference."</li>
        <li><strong>Prognosis:</strong> Projects significant impairment by age 30, with complex communion becoming unreliable within 5–7 years</li>
        <li><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Suggests the deterioration may be due to sustained active use of her telepathic abilities rather than passive aging</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Her findings create urgent pressure to develop technological alternatives to Celectra's biological bridge function.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Medical Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Dr. Chen embodies a specific medical approach:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data-Driven:</strong> Relies on quantitative measurements and clean-environment testing</li>
        <li><strong>Clinically Honest:</strong> Delivers difficult news without sugarcoating but with professional compassion</li>
        <li><strong>Long-Term Tracking:</strong> Maintains consistent monitoring over years to identify trends</li>
        <li><strong>Interdisciplinary:</strong> Bridges obstetrics, radiation medicine, and emerging neurophysiology</li>
        <li><strong>Pragmatic:</strong> Focuses on what can be measured and projected rather than speculation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>Jenni Carisco:</strong> Patient relationship during the critical 2225 diagnosis. Dr. Chen was the first to inform Jenni about the twin pregnancy and radiation risks.</p>
      <p><strong>Celectra Carisco:</strong> Monitoring physician in Book 3. Maintains a professional, data-focused relationship while delivering difficult prognostic information.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Alexander Cruiz:</strong> Professional predecessor and colleague. Dr. Chen replaced him on Utopis Station when he moved to Ares.</p>
      <p><strong>Medical Community:</strong> Respected senior physician with expertise in space radiation effects—a critical specialty for colony medicine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Legacy & Impact</h2>
      <p>Dr. Chen's work has shaped colony history in multiple ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Diagnostic Precision:</strong> Her 2225 diagnosis directly informed Jenni's decision to continue the pregnancy despite risks</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Continuity:</strong> Provided stable medical leadership on Utopis Station during transition periods</li>
        <li><strong>Bridge Monitoring:</strong> Her Book 3 findings create timeline pressure for technological solutions to interspecies communication</li>
        <li><strong>Radiation Expertise:</strong> Her specialization remains critical for a colony living under a binary star system</li>
        <li><strong>Historical Link:</strong> Connects the early Utopis era to current Ares developments through her long career</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As both witness to the beginning of Celectra's story and monitor of its potential end, Dr. Chen bookends one of the colony's most important narratives.</p>
