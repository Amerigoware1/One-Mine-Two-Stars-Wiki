      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Sam is a young genderfluid resident who relocated from Utopis Space Station to New Eden in search of independence and self-discovery. Born with congenital atrichia, they have embraced their unique appearance as part of their fluid identity, using fashion and headwear to express their mood and presentation. Known for their warmth, curiosity, and emotional intelligence, Sam forms deep connections easily and serves as a bridge between diverse cultural backgrounds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Physical Appearance</h2>
      <p>Sam has congenital atrichia universalis, meaning they have no body hair, eyebrows, or eyelashes from birth. Their smooth, reflective scalp is often accentuated with oils, shimmer, or elaborate headwear. They possess a slender, wiry build adapted to low-gravity station life, granting them notable agility. Sam's eyes are strikingly expressive, conveying emotions through subtle micro-expressions that others quickly learn to read.</p>
      <p>Their presentation shifts fluidly: feminine days feature flowing skirts, pastel wigs, and layered jewelry; masculine days emphasize sharp lines, structured clothing, and a bare, polished scalp; neutral days favor oversized utility wear or jumpsuits with minimal adornment. A signature collection of scarves, wraps, circlets, and metallic bands serves as a visual indicator of their current mood.</p>
