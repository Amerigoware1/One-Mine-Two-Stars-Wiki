      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Councilor Kenji Yamoto is a respected member of the New Eden Colony Council with responsibility for environmental systems and sustainable agriculture. With an engineering background focused on closed ecological systems, Yamoto oversees the colony's life support infrastructure, hydroponic farms, and atmospheric regulation. His pragmatic, data-driven approach has been instrumental in maintaining New Eden's environmental balance through years of expansion and population growth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Council Role & Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>As Environmental Systems Director, Councilor Yamoto manages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Atmospheric Regulation:</strong> Monitoring and maintaining breathable air quality throughout colony habitats</li>
        <li><strong>Hydroponic Agriculture:</strong> Overseeing food production systems that feed the growing colony population</li>
        <li><strong>Water Reclamation:</strong> Managing the closed-loop water systems essential for survival on Ares</li>
        <li><strong>Waste Processing:</strong> Ensuring efficient conversion of waste into usable resources</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Experiments:</strong> Authorizing and monitoring research like the algae experiment mentioned in Book 3</li>
      </ul>
      <p>His position requires constant vigilance; as he noted during Xan's demonstration, even minor pressure variances (-0.3 kPa) must be tracked and understood.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Role in Key Council Decisions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Amerigo's Succession:</strong> Voted in favor of Amerigo Carisco replacing Dr. Troy as Chief Scientist (Book 3, Chapter 2)</li>
        <li><strong>Xan's Glockenspiel Demonstration:</strong> Witnessed and validated Xan's acoustic communication method with Chime (Book 3, Chapter 4)</li>
        <li><strong>Mining & Agriculture Conflicts:</strong> Frequently mediates between expansion advocates like Webb and conservation-focused councilors</li>
        <li><strong>Technological Bridge Funding:</strong> Supported allocation of resources for developing synthetic Galinstanian communication interfaces</li>
        <li><strong>Population Growth Planning:</strong> Advocates for sustainable expansion that doesn't overtax life support systems</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Notable Scene: The Glockenspiel Code</h2>
      <p>Councilor Yamoto plays a key role in Book 3, Chapter 4 during Xan's demonstration of his acoustic communication system:</p>
      <p>"Xan’s mallets moved in a deliberate, rhythmic pattern... The chamber held its breath. The answer came slower than with Celectra’s communion. A delay of several seconds. Then the stones chimed again, a different harmonic cluster. Acknowledgment. Data. Atmospheric pressure variance in Sector 4: minus 0.3 kilopascals. Query: intentional?"</p>
      <p>"Councilor Yamoto jolted. 'That’s correct. The algae experiment. But how…?'"</p>
      <p>This moment demonstrated both the effectiveness of Xan's method and the Galinstanians' ability to perceive environmental changes humans might miss. Yamoto's shocked recognition validated the system's accuracy and practical utility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Professional Relationships</h2>
      <p>Councilor Yamoto maintains working relationships across colony departments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Amerigo Carisco:</strong> Respects his scientific leadership; supported his succession to Chief Scientist</li>
        <li><strong>Councilor Webb:</strong> Often finds himself balancing Webb's expansionist agenda with environmental realities</li>
        <li><strong>Dr. Lorain Troy:</strong> Worked closely with her on environmental aspects of xenobiology research</li>
        <li><strong>Xan Carisco:</strong> Impressed by his innovative communication system; sees practical applications for environmental monitoring</li>
        <li><strong>Celectra Carisco:</strong> Values her bridge function for understanding Galinstanian perceptions of environmental changes</li>
        <li><strong>Agricultural Director Chen:</strong> Daily collaborator on food production and resource allocation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Philosophy & Approach</h2>
      <p>Yamoto operates on several core principles:</p>
      <p><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making:</strong> "Every kilopascal matters. Every degree of temperature variance. On Ares, we don't have the luxury of Earth's buffer systems."</p>
      <p><strong>Sustainable Growth:</strong> Advocates for population and expansion rates that match life support capacity</p>
      <p><strong>Interdisciplinary Collaboration:</strong> Frequently bridges engineering, science, and diplomacy in his work</p>
      <p><strong>Respect for Indigenous Knowledge:</strong> The glockenspiel demonstration revealed Galinstanians could detect environmental changes humans missed, leading to greater appreciation for their perspective</p>
      <p>His approach represents the careful balance required to maintain a human colony on an alien world while respecting its native consciousness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Technical Background</h2>
      <p>Before cryosleep and arrival on Ares, Yamoto specialized in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Closed Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) design</li>
        <li>Martian and lunar habitat environmental systems (pre-Ares colonization research)</li>
        <li>Atmospheric processing and gas balancing</li>
        <li>Radiation shielding integrated with environmental controls</li>
        <li>0.9g adaptation studies (corrected from previous 0.38g assumption)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This expertise made him an ideal candidate for overseeing New Eden's life support infrastructure, where margin for error is minimal.</p>
