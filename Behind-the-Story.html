  <h1>Behind the Story: The Inspiration for One Mind, Two Stars</h1>
  
  <div class="card-bg">
    <h2>The Spark of an Idea</h2>
    <p>The central concept of <em>One Mind, Two Stars</em>—one consciousness inhabiting two bodies—was inspired many years ago by a documentary about conjoined twins Brittany and Abby Hensel.</p>
    
    <p>Their powerful declaration of being <strong>two distinct individuals</strong>, two complete persons sharing one physical space, stayed with me. My imagination, however, traveled in the opposite direction: <strong>What if biology presented the world with two separate bodies, but consciousness had chosen—or been forced into—a singular existence within them?</strong></p>
    
    <div class="card-bg">
      <p><em>"Real twins showed me the incredible reality of two selves in one space. My fiction wonders about the inverse: one self in two spaces. Both explorations celebrate the profound mystery of consciousness and identity."</em></p>

    <h3>What This Story Is (And Isn't)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>This is NOT</strong> a story about conjoined twins or meant to represent their experience.</li>
      <li><strong>This IS</strong> a work of science fiction that uses that biological framework to explore questions of identity, autonomy, and connection from a completely different angle.</li>
      <li><strong>This IS</strong> a story born from curiosity and respect for the diversity of human experience.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>My deepest respect and gratitude go to real twins like the Hensels, whose lives and voices illuminated the path to asking my own, fictional questions.</p>

  <h2>From Inspiration to Universe</h2>
  <p>From that initial "what if," the world of <em>One Mind, Two Stars</em> grew organically:</p>
