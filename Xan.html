        <h2 id="background" class="section-header gradient-title">Background</h2>
        <p>Alexander "Xan" Carisco is the younger brother of Celectra Carisco, born approximately one year after the events of <i>One Mind, Two Stars</i>. He is the son of Amerigo and Zoë Carisco, conceived during a time of relative peace following the first contact with the Galinstanians. Xan's birth represents the expansion of the Carisco family and symbolizes the ongoing integration of human life on Ares.</p>
        <p>By the time of <i>One Mind, Two Stars 2: The Northern Shadows</i>, Xan is six years old (Earth standard) and lives in New Eden with his family. He attends activities at the New Eden Activity Center, where he engages in typical childhood pursuits like playing with toys and observing the world around him. Unlike his sister, Xan shows no signs of the unique "Celectricity" or dual-body physiology resulting from prenatal radiation exposure, making him a "normal" human child in the colony.</p>

        <h2 id="personality" class="section-header gradient-title">Personality and Traits</h2>
        <p>Xan is portrayed as an innocent and empathetic child, often noticing subtle changes in his family's moods. He is curious about the world, particularly the astronomical phenomena visible from Ares, such as eclipses and the binary stars Niamh and Ciara. His playful nature is evident in his interactions, where he engages in simple games and conversations that reveal a budding understanding of complex emotions.</p>
        <p>Key traits include:</p>
        <ul class="list-container">
            <li class="list-item">Empathy: Xan frequently checks on Celectra's well-being, asking why she seems "tired" or "Ciara" (dim and heavy moods).</li>
            <li class="list-item">Innocence: He views the world through a child's lens, simplifying adult concepts like "emotional labor" into relatable terms.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Curiosity: Xan shows interest in the Galinstanians, asking if he will be "special" like his sister and learning about them through family teachings.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Playfulness: He enjoys toys and games, often lost in his own world, providing comic relief and grounding the story in everyday family life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To flesh out his character further, Xan could develop interests in astronomy or art, inspired by the unique skies of Ares and his sister's drawings. He might also exhibit a protective streak toward Celectra, wanting to "help" with her ambassador duties in childlike ways, such as drawing pictures of the Galinstanians for cultural exchange.</p>

                <h3 class="text-green-700 font-bold">Amerigo and Zoë Carisco (Parents)</h3>
                <p>Xan maintains a close, affectionate bond with his parents, calling them "Mommy" and "Daddy." He seeks reassurance from them and enjoys family routines, such as watching eclipses or sharing meals.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card-bg safe-zone">
                <h3 class="text-green-700 font-bold">Extended Family (Uncle Doc and Aunt Dee)</h3>
                <p>Xan interacts warmly with his aunt and uncle, who provide comic relief and additional support in the household.</p>

        <h2 id="development" class="section-header gradient-title">Character Development</h2>
        <p>In the outline for Book 2, Xan's arc evolves from an innocent little brother to one who begins to grasp his sister's extraordinary circumstances. Key moments include:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr class="table-header">
                    <th>Chapter/Event</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>Chapter 1</td><td>Notices Celectra's "Ciara mood" and suggests talking to a grown-up.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chapter 2</td><td>Asks why Celectra is tired; hears explanation of "emotional labor."</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chapter 26</td><td>Learns about Galinstanians from Celectra; questions his own "specialness."</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Xan's growth emphasizes themes of family, normalcy amid extraordinariness, and the innocence of childhood. Future development could involve him discovering his own talents, perhaps in mediation or creativity, contrasting Celectra's diplomatic role.</p>

        <h2 id="trivia" class="section-header gradient-title">Trivia</h2>
        <ul class="list-container">
            <li class="list-item">Xan's nickname "Xan" is a shortened form of Alexander, evoking a sense of adventure and exploration fitting for a child on Ares.</li>
            <li class="list-item">He is the first "post-contact" child in the Carisco family, born after human-Galinstanian relations were established.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Xan's observations often provide emotional grounding for Celectra, highlighting the story's themes of self-care and family support.</li>
