    <div id="overview" class="card-bg">
        <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
        <p>New Eden (Ares surface) and Utopis (orbital station) employ a hybrid educational model: core academic instruction is fully self-paced and home-based, managed by the AI Utara, while physical, artistic, social, and cultural learning occurs through human-led communal classes and facilities. This structure maximizes resource efficiency in a frontier environment while ensuring well-rounded development and community cohesion.</p>
        <p>Academic progression is individualized and mastery-based, spanning pre-kindergarten through postgraduate levels. Complementary activities—ranging from sports to cultural exchange—are scheduled at dedicated communal spaces, allowing students of all ages to interact and build interpersonal skills.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="academic" class="card-bg">
        <h2 class="section-header">Academic Education (Utara-Managed)</h2>
        <p>Core subjects are delivered exclusively in the home via holographic interfaces and interactive modules overseen by Utara. Progression depends on demonstrated mastery rather than age or fixed timelines. (Ages below are typical)</p>
        <ul class="list-container">
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Pre-Kindergarten (Ages 3–5):</strong> Foundational literacy, numeracy, emotional regulation, and environmental awareness.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Primary (Ages 5–12):</strong> Mathematics, sciences, languages, Earth and Ares history, ethics.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Secondary (Ages 12–18):</strong> Advanced applied sciences, programming, cognitive studies, interspecies diplomacy electives.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>Postsecondary (18+):</strong> University majors and postgraduate specializations (e.g., Applied Cognitive Science with Neuro-Linguistic & Multiplicity Studies).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Assessment consists of continuous projects, simulations, and mastery thresholds (typically 80%+ proficiency).</p>
    </div>

    <div id="communal" class="card-bg">
        <h2 class="section-header">Communal and Human-Led Education</h2>
        <p>Physical education, arts, music, and elective skill-building classes are conducted by human instructors in shared facilities. These sessions are open to students and adults, fostering intergenerational learning and social bonds.</p>
        <p>On Utopis, dedicated rooms within the orbital habitat host music, zero-gravity movement classes, and other specialized activities. On Ares, the central Activities Center serves as the primary hub.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="activities" class="card-bg">
        <h2 class="section-header">The Activities Center: "Mall of Motion"</h2>
        <p>Affectionately nicknamed the "Mall of Motion," New Eden's Activities Center is a multi-level complex housing:</p>
        <ul class="list-container">
            <li class="list-item">Indoor swimming pools and training lanes</li>
            <li class="list-item">Sundome karate dojos (emphasizing inch-stop precision and control)</li>
            <li class="list-item">Dance studios (various styles)</li>
            <li class="list-item">Acrobatics and gymnastics halls with padded flooring and apparatus</li>
            <li class="list-item">Weight-lifting and strength-training gyms</li>
            <li class="list-item">Indoor courts for volleyball, basketball, and adapted Ares sports</li>
            <li class="list-item">Music rooms and performance spaces</li>
            <li class="list-item">Outdoor fields (for residents without photosensitivity restrictions)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Classes are scheduled flexibly to accommodate self-paced academic timelines, with drop-in options and structured courses available.</p>
        <div id="pe-groups" class="card-bg">
    <h2 class="section-header">Physical Education and Sports Age Groups</h2>
    <p>For safety and developmental appropriateness, communal physical education classes and sports activities segregate participants into age-based groups. This prevents mismatches in size, strength, and coordination that could lead to injury.</p>
    <ul class="list-container">
        <li class="list-item"><strong>4–6 years</strong>: Focus on basic motor skills, play-based movement, and fun introduction to games.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>7–10 years</strong>: Introduction to rules, technique, and light competition with modified equipment.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>11–14 years</strong>: Increased intensity, strategy, and skill refinement.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>15+ years</strong>: Full competition rules, advanced training, and strength-focused options.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Groupings may be adjusted based on enrollment or activity type. Exceptionally skilled or mature students may occasionally “play up” a group with instructor and parental approval, but safety remains paramount. Transitions between groups often coincide with birthdays, which can feel noticeable—Celectra, for example, experienced a sudden shift in dynamics when moving from the oldest in the 4–6 group to the youngest in the 7–10 group shortly after turning seven on Utopis.</p>

    <div id="galinstanian" class="card-bg">
        <h2 class="section-header">Galinstanian Cultural Education</h2>
        <p>Following First Contact, dedicated modules and communal sessions introduce Galinstanian culture, philosophy, and resonance-based communication. These include:</p>
        <ul class="list-container">
            <li class="list-item">Utara-guided virtual simulations of collective thought patterns</li>
            <li class="list-item">Human-led discussion groups and empathy exercises</li>
            <li class="list-item">Cave visits (supervised) for direct observation</li>
            <li class="list-item">Art and music collaborations blending human and Galinstanian forms (e.g., EM symphonies)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Celectra Carisco frequently contributes drawings, explanations, and curriculum design to make Galinstanian concepts accessible and non-threatening to younger students.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="utara-role" class="card-bg">
        <h2 class="section-header">Utara's Role</h2>
        <p>Utara serves as primary academic instructor, curriculum designer, progress tracker, and wellness monitor. She adapts difficulty in real time, suggests breaks, and coordinates schedules with communal activities. Practical life skills (cooking, gardening) are also taught through guided home simulations with parental assistance.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="adaptations" class="card-bg">
        <h2 class="section-header">Adaptations and Exceptions</h2>
        <p>Individual needs are prioritized:</p>
        <ul class="list-container">
            <li class="list-item">Photosensitive students (e.g., Celectra) are restricted to indoor/low-UV activities.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Accommodations available for students with physical or mental disabilities (extremely rare).</li>
            <li class="list-item">Burnout detection with mandatory rest recommendations.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="history" class="card-bg">
        <h2 class="section-header">History and Development</h2>
        <p>The system originated from resource-limited early migration needs, evolving from remote Earth models into full AI oversight. Post-First Contact updates incorporated Galinstanian cultural components, with ongoing Council discussions about enhancing social elements through expanded communal programming.</p>
