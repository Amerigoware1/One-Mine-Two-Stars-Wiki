      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Dr. Douglas Kret was the founding Chief of Medicine of the Ares Colony and a brilliant researcher in neurology and genetics. Following the death of his wife Mara in 2122, he became obsessed with conquering mortality through consciousness transfer research. This obsession led to increasingly unethical experiments, first on Celectra Carisco and later on Galinstanian beings, resulting in his eventual exile. His story represents the dangers of unchecked scientific ambition fueled by unresolved grief.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-400 italic">"I hope that you never lose someone the way I lost her." — Douglas Kret, Second Tribunal</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Physical Appearance</h2>
      <p>Tall and lean with a distinguished presence, Kret had steel blue eyes that were described as both piercing and detached. By the time of the Ares colonization, his hair had turned fully gray, adding to his authoritative appearance. In his later years, following exile, reports describe him as diminished, with the same intensity now turned inward.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Early Life and Career</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Born on Earth in 2084, showed early aptitude in biological sciences</li>
        <li>Earned medical degree followed by dual doctorates in neurology and genetics</li>
        <li>Married Mara in 2110; their daughter Zoë was born in 2106</li>
        <li>Applied for the Ares colonization program as a medical specialist</li>
        <li>Arrived on the Utopis generation ship July 20, 2215</li>
        <li>Served as Chief of Medicine for the fledgling colony, respected for his expertise</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">The Turning Point: Mara's Death</h2>
      <p>On March 20, 2122, Mara Kret died in a shuttle accident at age 34. This loss devastated Douglas, who withdrew emotionally from his daughter Zoë and became increasingly focused on his work. His research interests shifted decisively toward consciousness studies, with particular emphasis on preservation and transfer—a clear, if unspoken, response to his grief.</p>
      <p>Zoë Kret (later Carisco) testified at his second tribunal: <em>"My father is not a monster. He is a brilliant man who allowed unprocessed grief to collapse inward until it defined his gravity... He let himself orbit my mother long after she was gone, and it consumed him."</em></p>

   <div class="card-bg">
  <h2 class="section-header">Experiments on Celectra Carisco (Book 1 - 2232)</h2>
  
  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">First Incident: The Omni-Tomography Machine</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>After keeping 7-year-old Celectra overnight for "observations," Kret forced one of her bodies into an Omni-tomography machine</li>
    <li>The machine's shielding cut off her connection between bodies, causing immediate physiological distress</li>
    <li>Celectra's right body experienced cardiac arrest while isolated from her left body's consciousness</li>
    <li>Emergency resuscitation was required</li>
    <li>Amerigo Carisco, upon learning what happened, immediately took Celectra back to Utopis Station</li>
    <li>Amerigo formally forbade Kret from any further contact with or experimentation on Celectra</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Second Incident: Deliberate Isolation Testing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>When Amerigo was called away to Utopis-Lab 2 on urgent business, Celectra was left in the care of Dr. Alex Cruiz and Dee Cruiz</li>
    <li>Kret used political connections and bureaucratic manipulation to gain access to Celectra again</li>
    <li>This time, he deliberately separated her bodies behind electromagnetic barriers to measure her connection limits</li>
    <li>He subjected her to systematic isolation, pushing her dual-body consciousness to its breaking point</li>
    <li>Celectra required resuscitation at least once during these procedures</li>
    <li>Traumatized and desperate, Celectra escaped and fled into the Ares cave systems</li>
    <li>During her time in the caves, she made first contact with the Galinstanians, discovering Stan and beginning her role as the bridge</li>
    <li>Kret was arrested while searching for her in the caves</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">First Tribunal and Initial Sentencing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Charged with child endangerment, violation of medical ethics, and unauthorized experimentation</li>
    <li>Stripped of his position as Chief of Medicine (succeeded by Dr. Alex Cruiz)</li>
    <li>Medical license suspended for human patients</li>
    <li>Exiled to serve as medic and cook with the planetary survey team</li>
    <li>Placed under probation with strict supervision requirements</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 italic">"He sees consciousness as a problem to solve, not a life to respect. When he examined me, I was a fascinating anomaly—two bodies, one mind, unprecedented neural architecture. He wanted to understand how it worked, map it, document it. What I felt during those examinations didn't factor into his calculations." — Celectra Carisco, Second Tribunal Testimony</p>
</div>

<div class="card-bg">
  <h2 class="section-header">The Northern Cluster Experiments (Book 2 - 2239)</h2>
  <p>Seven years after his first sentencing, while exiled with the survey team, Kret deliberately sought out and found an isolated Galinstanian cluster in the northern territories. His actions represent his most severe escalation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Planned the operation for three months, waiting for isolation to conduct experiments</li>
    <li>Applied lessons learned from Celectra's case to non-human subjects</li>
    <li>Captured a young Galinstanian (developmental equivalent of a 2-year-old human)</li>
    <li>Subjected the being to 72 hours of sensory deprivation and isolation using electromagnetic dampening fields</li>
    <li>Prevented the cluster from communicating with their captured member</li>
    <li>Documented the suffering as "valuable data" on consciousness substrate transfer</li>
    <li>Sabotaged rescue operations, causing a structural collapse that trapped 15 people</li>
  </ul>
</div>
      
      <p>Celectra's testimony: <em>"'Temporary discomfort.' That's what he called seventy-two hours of isolation torture inflicted on a two-year-old equivalent... That's someone who's lost the ability to see other beings as mattering beyond their utility to his goals."</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Second Tribunal and Sentencing</h2>
      <p>Charges: Willful violation of probation terms, torture of sapient beings, reckless endangerment of human life, unauthorized research on protected subjects, and destruction of colony property.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Key Testimony</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Amerigo Carisco</strong>: Presented physical evidence including Kret's journals documenting three months of planning</li>
        <li><strong>Chief Evelyn Roan</strong>: Detailed the sabotage of rescue operations and resulting injuries</li>
        <li><strong>Dr. Alex Cruiz</strong>: Medical documentation of Galinstanian trauma comparable to "prolonged sensory deprivation torture of a two-year-old child"</li>
        <li><strong>Celectra Carisco</strong>: Described the psychological impact on the northern cluster and drew parallels to her own experiences</li>
        <li><strong>Dr. Zoë Carisco</strong>: Provided psychological analysis of her father's grief-driven obsession</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Sentence</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Permanent exile from Ares</li>
        <li>Medical license permanently revoked</li>
        <li>Transfer to Utopis-Lab 1, remote research station in orbit around Amaterasu</li>
        <li>No contact with any Galinstanian populations, ever</li>
        <li>No research privileges involving consciousness, sapient subjects, or consciousness transfer</li>
        <li>Mandatory psychiatric treatment for unresolved grief and obsessive ideation</li>
        <li>Research credentials permanently revoked</li>
        <li>Violation terms: Immediate recycling without appeal</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="mt-4">Kret pleaded guilty to all charges. His final statement: <em>"I hope that you never lose someone the way I lost her."</em></p>
      <p>Celectra's response: <em>"I hope that I never lose myself the way you did."</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Philosophy and Motivation</h2>
      <p>Kret's driving philosophy was the pursuit of universal immortality through consciousness transfer. Beneath this lofty goal lay unresolved grief over Mara's death and a desperate attempt to cheat mortality itself.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Core Beliefs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Consciousness is data that can be preserved and transferred</li>
        <li>The ends (universal immortality) justify any means</li>
        <li>Sapient beings are primarily research subjects when scientific progress is at stake</li>
        <li>Emotional suffering is "temporary discomfort" compared to eternal preservation</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400">Zoë Carisco's analysis: <em>"Every violation he committed, every boundary he crossed, he justified with 'If Mara were here' or 'for the sake of preventing future loss.' The hypothetical resurrection of a dead woman became more important to him than the safety of living, sapient beings."</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Legacy and Impact</h2>
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Negative Impact</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Traumatized Celectra Carisco during her childhood</li>
        <li>Caused severe psychological damage to the northern Galinstanian cluster</li>
        <li>Damaged early human-Galinstanian relations in unexplored regions</li>
        <li>Created lasting trauma for his daughter Zoë</li>
        <li>Endangered rescue personnel through sabotage</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Paradoxical Contribution (Book 3)</h3>
      <p>Despite his unethical methods, Kret's research contained valuable insights into consciousness-EM field interactions. In Book 3, his confiscated research becomes crucial to developing technological alternatives to Celectra's natural bridge abilities, creating profound ethical dilemmas for the research team.</p>
      
      <p class="mt-4">Amerigo Carisco's position: <em>"Science doesn't have morality. Scientists do. We can learn from his methods while condemning his ethics. The knowledge exists. Pretending it doesn't doesn't undo the harm he caused."</em></p>
      
      <p>Zoë Carisco's position: <em>"As his daughter and Celectra's mother, I have to live with both legacies. Use the research. But never forget where it came from or what it cost."</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Current Status</h2>
      <p>As of the end of Book 2, Douglas Kret is confined to Utopis-Lab 1, a mobile research platform in orbit around Amaterasu (the outermost planet in the system). Stripped of all titles and research privileges, he performs menial maintenance tasks under constant supervision. He receives mandatory psychiatric treatment but shows little progress according to reports.</p>
      
      <p>His daughter Zoë maintains no contact, having testified against him at both tribunals. The colony archive preserves his research under strict ethical oversight, accessible only for review by approved committees considering the moral implications of using knowledge gained through torture.</p>
