      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Dr. Alexander "Alex" Cruiz is the Chief of Medicine for New Eden Colony and Amerigo Carisco's closest friend. A calm, compassionate physician with a keen scientific mind, he played a crucial role in Celectra Carisco's medical care and later succeeded Dr. Douglas Kret as Chief of Medicine after Kret's ethical violations. Known affectionately as "Uncle Doc" to Celectra and "Uncle Alex" to the wider family, he represents the ethical, patient-centered approach to medicine that Kret abandoned.</p>
      <p>Alex and his wife Dee relocated from Utopis Station to New Eden after his promotion, moving into the house opposite the Cariscos in Zoë's former residence, cementing their role as extended family.</p>

        <li><strong>Ethical rigor</strong>: Maintains strict adherence to medical ethics, even when research opportunities are tempting</li>
        <li><strong>Holistic perspective</strong>: Considers psychological and social factors alongside physical health</li>
        <li><strong>Preventive focus</strong>: Emphasizes prevention and community health over dramatic interventions</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative practice</strong>: Works closely with other specialists, including Zoë's psychological expertise</li>
      </ul>
