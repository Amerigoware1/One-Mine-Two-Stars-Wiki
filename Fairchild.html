      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Terry Fairchild is a senior nurse with over two decades of medical experience who served as Celectra Carisco's primary caregiver during Dr. Douglas Kret's unethical experimentation period in 2232. Of multiracial heritage from Durban, South Africa, Fairchild presents with intentionally neutral features that reflect their non-binary identity. Despite being employed by Dr. Kret, they maintained strong ethical boundaries and provided crucial compassionate care to the traumatized seven-year-old Celectra, ultimately playing a key role in exposing Kret's misconduct.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Appearance & Demeanor</h2>
      <p>As observed by Celectra during their first meeting: "Their features were pleasantly neutral, neither conventionally masculine nor feminine, and their short hair offered no additional clues." Fairchild's professional appearance reflects their intentional rejection of gender binaries, with Dr. Kret's correct use of they/them pronouns noted by Celectra as "at least basic respect."</p>
      <p>Their demeanor combines professional competence with genuine compassion—a balance that proved crucial during the traumatic separation experiment. Fairchild's multiracial background from Durban informs their perspective, bringing cultural sensitivity to their medical practice in the diverse colony environment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Role During Kret's Experiments</h2>
      <p>Fairchild served as Dr. Kret's assistant during his unethical research on Celectra's mononous disoma condition, but frequently found themselves torn between professional duty and moral conviction.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compassionate Caregiver:</strong> Regularly brought Celectra breakfast in bed, played Neutralize with her (losing three consecutive matches), and provided emotional support</li>
        <li><strong>Early Recognition:</strong> Quickly understood Celectra was one person across two bodies after observing her terror at separation</li>
        <li><strong>Moral Conflict:</strong> Displayed visible discomfort during procedures, hesitating when ordered to restrain Celectra</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Intervention:</strong> During the catastrophic separation experiment, Fairchild's composure cracked as they screamed "She's DEAD!" and demanded the chamber be opened</li>
        <li><strong>Life-Saving Action:</strong> Performed CPR on Celeste's body while Dr. Kret checked Electra, demonstrating their medical skill under extreme pressure</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Key Scenes & Dialogue</h2>
      <p><strong>The Morning After:</strong> "Terry Fairchild approached Celectra’s room quietly and knocked softly... Having watched the child’s obvious terror of being separated, Terry felt any lingering doubts vanish—Celectra was definitely a single person."</p>
      <p><strong>During the Separation:</strong> "Terry hesitated, their face a mask of moral conflict. 'Sir, maybe we should reconsider—' 'Now, Nurse.' With obvious reluctance, they helped restrain Celeste while Dr. Kret secured the straps around Electra."</p>
      <p><strong>The Emergency:</strong> "Terry dropped to their knees beside the still form, fingers frantically seeking a pulse. 'She’s not breathing! No heartbeat!'... 'She’s DEAD!' Terry’s composure finally cracked. 'Open the chamber! NOW!'"</p>
      <p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> "Dr. Kret turned to Terry with barely controlled anger. 'Check her vitals again.'... Terry watched him leave, feeling a mixture of relief and disgust. They’d been a nurse for twenty-two years, but they’d never felt so ashamed of their profession."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Ethical Stance & Professional Impact</h2>
      <p>Fairchild's experience with Kret fundamentally shaped their approach to medical ethics in New Eden:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Patient Advocacy:</strong> Became a vocal advocate for patient autonomy and consent, especially for vulnerable populations</li>
        <li><strong>Trauma-Informed Care:</strong> Developed protocols for medical care of patients with unique physiological conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Whistleblower Role:</strong> Their testimony, combined with Utara's records, helped convict Dr. Kret</li>
        <li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> Now trains younger medical staff on ethical decision-making and boundary maintenance</li>
        <li><strong>Colony Trust:</strong> Earned respect from the Carisco family and broader community for their integrity under pressure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As they told Amerigo Carisco: "I don't believe he intended to harm her, but he showed complete disregard for her safety." This distinction between malice and reckless arrogance informed colony medical ethics reforms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>Celectra Carisco:</strong> Developed a protective, almost parental relationship with the child, seeing past her unique physiology to the vulnerable person within. Their morning interactions (breakfast, games) provided normalcy amidst trauma.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Douglas Kret:</strong> Professional relationship marked by growing moral revulsion. Fairchild followed orders until crossing an ethical line, then became Kret's most effective accuser.</p>
      <p><strong>Amerigo Carisco:</strong> Earned his trust through honest assessment of events: "I know you're not to blame, Terry." Their forthright testimony helped Amerigo understand what happened to his daughter.</p>
      <p><strong>Utara (AI):</strong> Worked in parallel with the AI system, both recognizing the emergency and triggering override protocols.</p>
      <p><strong>Medical Community:</strong> Respected senior figure who now chairs ethics review committees and mentors new medical staff.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Legacy & Later Career</h2>
      <p>Following the Kret incident, Fairchild continued serving New Eden's medical needs while advocating for reform:</p>
      <p><strong>Ethics Committee:</strong> Appointed to colony medical ethics board, helping draft protections for unique physiological cases</p>
      <p><strong>Trauma Specialist:</strong> Became go-to caregiver for patients with unusual medical conditions or trauma histories</p>
      <p><strong>Education:</strong> Develops training modules on consent, patient autonomy, and ethical boundary maintenance</p>
      <p><strong>Community Role:</strong> Serves as trusted medical advisor to the Carisco family and other founding colony families</p>
      <p>Their career demonstrates that medical professionalism encompasses both technical skill and moral courage—a lesson learned through painful experience with Dr. Kret's dangerous ambition.</p>
