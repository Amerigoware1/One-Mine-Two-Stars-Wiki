    <h2 class="section-header">Biography</h2>
    <div class="card-bg">
    <h3>Early Life and Arrival</h3>
    <p>Born and raised in Tucson, Arizona, Amerigo developed an early fascination with solar materials and desert geology. He attended university in New Mexico, where he met Jenni Carisco, Alex Cruiz, Dee, and Zoë Kret. Together, they joined the Utopis colonist program in their early 20s.</p>
    <p>Amerigo traveled from Earth to the Chaos system in cryosleep, a journey taking seventy‑eight years. He and Jenni were among the 296 survivors of the original 300 colonists who arrived to build New Eden.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card-bg">
    <h3>The Solar Flare and Loss of Jenni</h3>
    <p>While Amerigo was on Utopis Station, Jenni was on a survey mission on Utopis‑Lab 3 when a solar mass ejection occurred. Jenni was exposed to radiation while pregnant with twins. Six months later, due to placental damage caused by the radiation, Jenni died during childbirth. Before passing, she made Amerigo promise to take care of their children, insisting they were “special.”</p>
</div>
    <div class="card-bg">
    <h3>Raising Celectra</h3>
    <p>Amerigo raised Celectra on Utopis Station as a single father. For the first seven years of her life, he believed she was two identical twin sisters, Celeste and Electra. On Celectra’s seventh birthday, he observed that Celeste could feel sensations applied to Electra’s body. Dr. Alex Cruiz confirmed Celectra was a single consciousness inhabiting two bodies (mononous disomas).</p>
</div>
    <div class="card-bg">
    <h3>Conflict with Dr. Kret</h3>
    <p>Amerigo fiercely protected Celectra when <a href="Douglas_Kret.html">Dr. Douglas Kret</a> attempted to claim jurisdiction over her medical care. When Dr. Kret traumatized Celectra during unauthorized separation experiments, Amerigo leveraged his political and professional connections to launch a rescue mission and secure a restraining order against Kret.</p>
</div>
    <div class="card-bg">
    <h3>First Contact</h3>
    <p>Amerigo was one of the first three humans to make peaceful contact with the <a href="Galinstanians.html">Galinstanians</a> within the caves of Ares. He was instrumental in establishing initial trust between the species.</p>
</div>
    <div class="card-bg">
    <h3>Life in New Eden</h3>
    <p>Following the tribunal of Dr. Kret, Amerigo moved permanently from Utopis Station to the surface of Ares to work in the new science facility. He entered a romantic relationship with Dr. Zoë Kret, eventually marrying her. Seven years later, they are raising Celectra and their young son, Xan, in New Eden.</p>
    <p>During the events of the “Northern Disturbance,” Amerigo joined the rescue team to extract the Galinstanians and apprehend Dr. Kret in the northern territories.</p>
