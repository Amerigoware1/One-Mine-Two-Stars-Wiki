      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Sensei Onishi Kisa is the head martial arts instructor at New Eden Colony's Sundome Karate Dojo and a respected member of the Athletics Committee. Hailing from Okinawa, Japan—the birthplace of karate—Sensei Kisa brings centuries of martial tradition to Ares while adapting them to the colony's unique 0.9g environment. Known for their wisdom, fairness, and advocacy for all athletes, they played a crucial role in supporting Celectra Carisco's participation in competitive karate despite her unique dual-body physiology.</p>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Teaching Philosophy & Approach</h2>
      <p>Sensei Kisa's teaching combines traditional martial arts values with practical adaptation to extraterrestrial living:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Respect for Individuality:</strong> "She is who she is. We do not ask tall competitors to fight on their knees. Celectra's body is her body."</li>
        <li><strong>Discipline Over Natural Advantage:</strong> Emphasizes that skill earned through practice matters more than inherent physical traits</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptation to 0.9g:</strong> Modified techniques to account for Ares' lower gravity while maintaining core principles</li>
        <li><strong>Mental Training:</strong> Integrates meditation and focus exercises alongside physical technique</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusive Excellence:</strong> Believes competition should accommodate diverse physiologies while maintaining fairness</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Key Role: Celectra's Tournament Participation</h2>
      <p>Sensei Kisa was Celectra's primary advocate during the heated Athletics Committee debates about her competition eligibility:</p>
      <p>"The debate had consumed three committee meetings over the past month. Celectra had sat through all of them, both bodies rigid with controlled frustration, while adults discussed her body like equipment rather than her. Sensei Onishi Kisa had been her advocate throughout."</p>
      <p>When the committee remained deadlocked, Celectra proposed her innovative solution: competing with only one body active while the other remained in meditative seiza. Sensei Kisa supported this compromise while recognizing its extraordinary difficulty.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Tournament Coaching & Insight</h2>
      <p>During the tournament, Sensei Kisa provided crucial support:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Preparation:</strong> Helped Celectra analyze each opponent's strengths and weaknesses</li>
        <li><strong>Mental Support:</strong> Recognized the strain of the stillness protocol: "The stillness protocol is harder than anyone realizes."</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Recovery:</strong> Worked on Celectra's shoulders between matches "with practiced hands"</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Wisdom:</strong> Before the finals: "There is always pressure. The question is whether you let it break you or shape you."</li>
        <li><strong>Post-Tournament Reflection:</strong> Helped Celectra process the silver medal as an achievement of discipline rather than a failure to win gold</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>Celectra Carisco:</strong> Respected student and advocate relationship. Sensei Kisa sees past Celectra's unique physiology to her dedication and skill. Their support was instrumental in Celectra's athletic achievements and self-confidence.</p>
      <p><strong>Councilor Okafor:</strong> Professional counterpart on the Athletics Committee. While Okafor initially questioned Celectra's eligibility, Sensei Kisa provided the principled defense that allowed for compromise.</p>
      <p><strong>Other Students:</strong> Maintains respectful relationships with all dojo members including Yuki Sato (tournament gold medalist), Kai Vasquez, Mika Okonkwo, Chen Wei, and Ren Tanaka.</p>
      <p><strong>Athletics Committee:</strong> Respected voice for fair competition and athlete wellbeing, often balancing competitive rigor with ethical considerations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Legacy & Impact</h2>
      <p>Sensei Kisa's influence extends beyond the dojo:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Precedent Setting:</strong> Their advocacy helped establish colony policies for athletes with unique physiologies</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural Preservation:</strong> Maintains Earth martial traditions while adapting them to new environment</li>
        <li><strong>Youth Development:</strong> Many colony children learn discipline, focus, and respect through their classes</li>
        <li><strong>Intergenerational Bridge:</strong> Connects older colonists (who remember Earth traditions) with Ares-born youth</li>
        <li><strong>Psychological Resilience:</strong> Their teaching helps colonists cope with the stresses of extraterrestrial life</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Their famous statement—"She is who she is"—became a touchstone for discussions about accommodating difference while maintaining excellence in New Eden.</p>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Training Adaptations for Ares</h2>
      <p>Sensei Kisa has modified traditional karate for Ares' conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>0.9g Adjustments:</strong> Modified jumping techniques, adjusted timing for falls and recoveries</li>
        <li><strong>Indoor Dojo:</strong> The Sundome provides controlled environment safe for Celectra's photosensitive skin</li>
        <li><strong>Dual-Body Training:</strong> Developed unique exercises for Celectra to coordinate both bodies in martial movements</li>
        <li><strong>Mental Discipline:</strong> Enhanced focus on meditation and concentration to complement physical training</li>
        <li><strong>Community Building:</strong> Uses martial arts as social glue in the isolated colony environment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Their dojo has become one of New Eden's most cherished community institutions, blending physical fitness, mental discipline, and cultural continuity.</p>
