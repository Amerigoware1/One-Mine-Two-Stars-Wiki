      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Dr. Lorain Troy served as the Chief Scientist of New Eden Colony for 35 years, providing steady leadership through the colony's most challenging periods of adaptation and first contact. A brilliant xenobiologist with deep ethical convictions, she was instrumental in establishing the scientific framework for human-Galinstanian relations. Her retirement in 2246 marked the end of an era and paved the way for Amerigo Carisco's succession.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">Professional Career</h2>
      <p>Dr. Troy arrived on Ares with the founding colony wave and quickly distinguished herself as a thoughtful, methodical scientist. Her leadership style emphasized collaboration, ethical rigor, and long-term sustainability over rapid expansion.</p>
      <p>She oversaw numerous critical initiatives including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Establishing the first xenobiology protocols for Ares</li>
        <li>Developing non-invasive study methods for indigenous life</li>
        <li>Chairing the committee that reviewed Celectra Carisco's Ph.D. defense</li>
        <li>Advocating for the ethical use of Dr. Douglas Kret's research</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Throughout her tenure, she maintained that "science doesn't have morality—scientists do," emphasizing personal ethical responsibility in research.</p>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Role in Key Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First Contact Protocols:</strong> Developed the initial scientific guidelines for interaction with Galinstanians after Celectra's discovery of Stan.</li>
        <li><strong>Kret's Tribunal:</strong> Provided expert testimony during Dr. Douglas Kret's trial for unethical experimentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Celectra's Development:</strong> Monitored Celectra's unique physiology and cognition, ensuring her wellbeing while facilitating her role as bridge.</li>
        <li><strong>Retirement & Succession:</strong> Voluntarily stepped down in 2246, recommending Amerigo Carisco as her successor in a unanimous Council vote.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Amerigo Carisco:</strong> Respected colleague and chosen successor. She recognized his balanced approach to science and ethics.</li>
        <li><strong>Celectra Carisco:</strong> Served as mentor and committee member for Celectra's Ph.D. defense. Admired her unique abilities while advocating for her autonomy.</li>
        <li><strong>Councilor Webb:</strong> Often found herself diplomatically opposing his "Ares-First" policies, advocating instead for cooperative coexistence.</li>
        <li><strong>Dr. Douglas Kret:</strong> Initially supported his research until ethical boundaries were crossed; later became his most vocal critic at tribunal.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="section-header">Legacy</h2>
      <p>Dr. Troy's retirement ceremony in late October 2246 honored her 35 years of service. Her legacy includes:</p>
      <p><strong>Scientific Ethics Framework:</strong> Established protocols that ensured New Eden's research respected indigenous consciousness and ecosystems.</p>
      <p><strong>Mentorship:</strong> Trained an entire generation of scientists, including Amerigo Carisco, in responsible xenobiology.</p>
      <p><strong>Institutional Stability:</strong> Provided consistent leadership that allowed the colony to navigate first contact and its aftermath without descending into exploitation or conflict.</p>
      <p>In her retirement speech, she stated: "The greatest measure of our science will not be what we discover, but how we choose to use that knowledge. We have built bridges between species; may we continue to build them between our ethics and our ambitions."</p>
