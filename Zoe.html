  <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Zoë Carisco is the colony’s leading clinical psychologist and the emotional heart of the Carisco family. Known for her calm presence, razor-sharp insight, and unshakable compassion, she serves as both a professional trauma specialist and the primary emotional regulator for her extraordinary daughter Celectra. Where Amerigo provides structure and protection, Zoë offers understanding—often the only person capable of pulling Celectra back when all four of her daughter’s hemispheres spiral into conflict or burnout.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-header">Early Life & Education</h2>
  <p>
    Born on Earth in 2103 to Dr. Douglas Kret, a pioneering neuroscientist whose groundbreaking (and ethically fraught) work on consciousness transfer would later define his legacy, Zoë grew up in the shadow of her father's relentless ambition. Despite the familial strains, she pursued her own path in psychology, attending the University of Toronto where she formed a lifelong friendship with Jenni Carisco during their undergraduate years. It was there she also met Amerigo Carisco, Jenni's husband, forging bonds that would endure beyond Earth's gravity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Zoë earned her doctorate in Clinical Psychology with a focus on developmental trauma and neurodivergence, graduating summa cum laude at age 24. Her thesis on "Resilient Attachment in Multi-Body Systems" foreshadowed her future work with Celectra, blending empathy with analytical precision.
  </p>
</div>

  <h2 class="section-header">Career on Ares</h2>
  <p>
    As part of the inaugural Ares colonization wave, Zoë arrived aboard the colony transport ship <i>Utopis</i> in 2215, alongside Amerigo, Jenni, and her father, Dr. Kret. Upon arrival, <i>Utopis</i> was ingeniously repurposed: its core became the orbital Utopis Station, while three sections were refitted into mobile research platforms (Utopis Labs 1-3). Zoë contributed to early psychological screening for colonists, helping mitigate the isolation of deep-space transit.
  </p>
  <p>
    In New Eden, she rapidly became the colony’s go-to expert for radiation-related psychological sequelae, PTSD, and the emerging field of “interspecies relational psychology.” By 2239, she supervises the Mental Health Directorate and personally oversees Celectra’s ongoing therapeutic care. Her private notes on mononous disoma psychology and Celectric resonance states are considered classified but groundbreaking.

  <h2 class="section-header">Role in the Carisco Family</h2>
  <p>
    Seven years after Jenni Carisco's tragic death, Zoë stepped into the role of mother with unwavering commitment, adopting Celectra as her own and providing the emotional scaffolding that allowed the child to thrive amid her unique neurology. She instinctively mirrors Celectra’s dual-body language, alternating eye contact and touch so that both bodies feel equally seen. Her gentle reframing—“bridges need maintenance too”—has become a family mantra and the philosophical core of Celectra’s eventual boundary-setting revolution.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the birth of Alexander "Xan" in 2233, Zoë models healthy integration of personal needs with professional and familial duty, showing Celectra that one can be both a caregiver and a person who is cared for.

  <h2 class="section-header">Relationship with the Galinstanians</h2>
  <p>
    Though she cannot receive communion herself, Zoë is one of the few humans the collective explicitly describes as “resonantly kind.” Stan once transmitted (through Celectra): <i>“Her presence is like cool water on heated stone—restorative without demand.”</i> The Galinstanians forged her wedding ring from pure bismuth as a gesture of gratitude for the emotional safety she extends to their bridge.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card-bg">
  <h2 class="section-header">Relationship with Dr. Douglas Kret</h2>
  <p>
    As the daughter of Dr. Kret, Zoë navigates a profoundly complex bond marked by love, disappointment, and professional distance. His obsessive pursuit of consciousness transfer—initially inspired by intellectual curiosity, later twisted by grief—has inflicted lasting trauma on Celectra and the Galinstanians. Yet Zoë's testimony during his 2239 tribunal remains clinically compassionate, framing his descent not as villainy but as a cautionary erosion of boundaries. Privately, she grapples with the inherited weight of his legacy, channeling it into her work on ethical neurodivergence.
