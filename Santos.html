      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Councilor Isabella Santos is the senior administrator and a founding member of the New Eden Colony Council. With over three decades of service, she has guided the colony through its most critical transitions, from early survival challenges to complex interspecies diplomacy. Known for her measured pragmatism and unwavering commitment to colony stability, Santos represents the institutional memory and procedural backbone of New Eden's governance.</p>
      <p>Her leadership style balances formality with genuine care for the community, embodying the colony's ethos of collective survival and growth. Santos has overseen key historical moments including the formal integration of the Listener Corps, the retirement of Chief Scientist Dr. Troy, and the transition of leadership to Amerigo Carisco.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Physical Appearance</h2>
      <p>In her late fifties, Santos carries herself with the poised authority of someone accustomed to responsibility. She has dark hair streaked with Ares-silver, kept in a practical but elegant style suitable for both council chambers and colony inspections. Her face bears the lines of both concern and warmth, with observant eyes that miss little in council proceedings.</p>
      <p>She typically wears functional but well-maintained colonial attire, often with subtle markers of office such as a council pin or data tablet. Despite her senior position, she maintains the physical capability for regular colony inspections, reflecting the colony's ethos that leadership remains connected to daily operations.</p>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Leadership Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Santos operates on a principle she calls "procedural compassion"—the belief that clear, fair systems ultimately serve people better than arbitrary decisions. This philosophy has guided her through difficult choices, from resource rationing to approving risky research initiatives.</p>
      <p>She values transparency and collective decision-making, often reminding council members that "we survive together or not at all." However, she's not afraid to make unilateral decisions during emergencies, understanding that her role carries ultimate responsibility for colony safety.</p>
      <p>Her approach to interspecies relations has evolved from cautious skepticism to guarded optimism, always prioritizing human safety while recognizing the mutual benefits of cooperation with the Galinstanians.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Personal Life</h2>
      <p>Santos lost her spouse, Dr. Elena Santos, to an early colony medical crisis, a loss that deeply shaped her commitment to colony safety systems. Her two children chose careers off-station, one on Utopis and another who returned to Earth-cycle shipping routes. This separation, while painful, has given her a broader perspective on the colony's place in the larger human diaspora.</p>
      <p>Outside council duties, she maintains a small aeroponics garden—a personal project she says "keeps me grounded in what we're really building here." She's known to have a dry wit that surfaces in less formal settings, and she maintains correspondence with several original colony founders who have since retired or moved to other settlements.</p>
      <p>Despite her seniority, she lives in standard colony housing, rejecting any special accommodations as "contrary to the equality we're building." This choice has earned her deep respect among long-term colonists.</p>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Relationships</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Amerigo Carisco:</strong> Respectful professional relationship; she values his scientific expertise while providing administrative guidance</li>
        <li><strong>Celectra Carisco:</strong> Initially skeptical of relying on a child for vital communications, now recognizes her unique contributions while pushing for sustainable systems</li>
        <li><strong>Dr. Troy:</strong> Worked closely for decades; oversaw her dignified retirement with genuine respect</li>
        <li><strong>Councilor Webb:</strong> Frequently debates with this infrastructure-focused colleague, but respects his practical concerns</li>
