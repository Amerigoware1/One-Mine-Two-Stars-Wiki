    <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
    <p>Celectra Ambar Carisco (born 11 October 2225) is the sole known human with mononous disomas—one consciousness permanently distributed across two identical female bodies connected by a proprietary electromagnetic field known as Celectricity. Born from catastrophic radiation exposure during a solar flare event aboard Utopis-Lab 3, she is widely regarded as the most significant bridge between human colonists and the indigenous Galinstanian species of Ares.</p>
          </div>
      <div class="card-bg">
    <h2 class="section-header">Physical Appearance</h2>
    <p>Celectra possesses two identical bodies of apparently prepubescent appearance (Estimated biological development equivalent to 9–10 years despite being 14 Earth years old.), standing 1.37 m tall with snow-white hair and extremely pale skin that burns within minutes of unfiltered exposure to Niamh's light. Her eyes are milk chocolate brown. Both bodies are always dressed identically or complementary, always cotton, usually dresses or loose rompers. The lightning-bolt earrings (yellow diamonds set in gold) are her signature accessory and a public symbol of her Celectricity.</p>

        <p class="font-semibold text-gray-600">Etiology:</p>
        <p class="text-gray-400">
          In utero exposure to a Niamh stellar flare while aboard Utopis‑Lab 3. High‑energy proton radiation during the first trimester caused complete melanocyte ablation, disrupted embryonic neural integration (resulting in mononous disomas), and severe placental vascular damage. The latter led to intrauterine growth restriction and eventual placental detachment, which proved fatal to her biological mother.

        <p class="font-semibold text-gray-600">Primary Risk:</p>
        <p class="text-danger">
          Extreme phototoxicity, aggressive skin carcinogenesis (melanoma & non‑melanoma), and systemic vulnerability to metabolic stress.

      <li>Prevented diplomatic collapse of human-Galinstanian treaty on three occasions (2232–2239)</li>
      <li>Engineered integration of previously isolated northern Galinstanian cluster (2239)</li>

    <h2 class="section-header">Personal Life</h2>
    <p>Celectra resides with her father, Amerigo Carisco, mother Zoë Carisco, and younger brother Alexander ("Xan") in New Eden's family housing sector. She is in a romantic relationship with Jaxon Bowers (as of 2239). Close friends include Ananya Patel (best friend), Maya Keahi, and Lira Keahi (mentor). She maintains daily communion with the Galinstanian collective, particularly the individual known as Stan, whom she regards as chosen family rather than romantic partner.</p>

    <p>Known for her dry humor and "Niamh moods" (happy, bright, and bubbly), occasional "Ciara moods" (periods of deep emotional/energetic depletion), Celectra has become a reluctant celebrity within the colony while actively working to normalize perceptions of both her condition and Galinstanian sentience.</p>
