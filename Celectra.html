    <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
    <p>Celectra Ambar Carisco (born 11 October 2225) is the sole known human with mononous disomas—one consciousness permanently distributed across two identical female bodies connected by a proprietary electromagnetic field known as Celectricity. Born from catastrophic radiation exposure during a solar flare event aboard Utopis-Lab 3, she is widely regarded as the most significant bridge between human colonists and the indigenous Galinstanian species of Ares.</p>
          </div>
      <div class="card-bg">
    <h2 class="section-header">Physical Appearance</h2>
    <p>Celectra possesses two identical bodies of apparently prepubescent appearance (Estimated biological development equivalent to 9–10 years (as of 2232) despite being 14 Earth years old.), standing 1.37 m tall with snow-white hair and extremely pale skin that burns within minutes of unfiltered exposure to Niamh's light. Her eyes are milk chocolate brown. Both bodies are always dressed identically or complementary, always cotton, usually dresses or loose rompers. The lightning-bolt earrings (yellow diamonds set in gold) are her signature accessory and a public symbol of her Celectricity.</p>
    <p>By age 21 (2239) in Book 3, Celectra has reached adulthood, though her stature remains very petite at 1.49 meters and 41 kg per body.</p>
  </div>
    <div class="card-bg">
    <h2 class="section-header">Neurological & Spatial Adaptations</h2>
    <p>To manage the cognitive load of a unified consciousness across two bodies, Celectra has developed consistent lateral specialization—a practical neurological adaptation that reduces spatial confusion and optimizes coordination.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Lateral Specialization</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consistent Positioning:</strong> Her “right” body remains on the right in shared spaces, her “left” body on the left. This is not merely habit but a mapped spatial territory her brain uses to avoid interference.</li>
      <li><strong>Task Allocation:</strong> Fine motor tasks (writing, tool use) are typically handled by her right body, while the left body manages stabilization, spatial awareness, or secondary tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental Navigation:</strong> She reaches for objects with the appropriate body’s hand based on spatial orientation, not proximity, minimizing coordination errors.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Examples in Daily Life</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Walking:</strong> In corridors, her bodies maintain a consistent side-by-side formation unless space constraints force single-file.</li>
      <li><strong>Seating:</strong> At tables, she always positions her right body on the right side, left body on the left.</li>
      <li><strong>Karate Training:</strong> During kata, her right body executes right-side blocks while her left body performs left-side strikes in fluid synchronization.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Interaction:</strong> In conversations, she orients her bodies to face the speaker with a slight offset, allowing both to maintain eye contact without appearing confrontational.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Cognitive Implications</h3>
    <p>This lateral mapping reduces the mental overhead of coordinating two physical forms. It allows her to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Process spatial information more efficiently</li>
      <li>Minimize “handrail confusion” (reaching with the wrong body’s hand)</li>
      <li>Maintain balance and coordination in complex environments</li>
      <li>Allocate attention between bodies without constant conscious recalibration</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="mt-4 italic text-gray-400">“It’s not that I think with one body and act with the other. I think as one, but my bodies have assigned neighborhoods in our shared space.” —Celectra, age 12</p>

      <div class="card-bg">
        <p class="font-semibold text-gray-600">Etiology:</p>
        <p class="text-gray-400">
          In utero exposure to a Niamh stellar flare while aboard Utopis‑Lab 3. High‑energy proton radiation during the first trimester caused complete melanocyte ablation, disrupted embryonic neural integration (resulting in mononous disomas), and severe placental vascular damage. The latter led to intrauterine growth restriction and eventual placental detachment, which proved fatal to her biological mother.

      <li>Prevented diplomatic collapse of human-Galinstanian treaty on three occasions (2232–2239)</li>
      <li>Engineered integration of previously isolated northern Galinstanian cluster (2239)</li>

      <li>Co-author of "Resonance Patterns: A Human Perspective on Galinstanian Cognition" (forthcoming)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
  <div class="card-bg">
    <h2 class="section-header">Personal Life</h2>
    <p>Celectra resides with her father, Amerigo Carisco, mother Zoë Carisco, and younger brother Alexander ("Xan") in New Eden's family housing sector. She is in a romantic relationship with Jaxon Bowers (as of 2239). Close friends include Ananya Patel (best friend), Maya Keahi, and Lira Keahi (mentor). She maintains daily communion with the Galinstanian collective, particularly the individual known as Stan, whom she regards as chosen family rather than romantic partner.</p>
    <p>Known for her dry humor and "Niamh moods" (happy, bright, and bubbly), occasional "Ciara moods" (periods of deep emotional/energetic depletion), Celectra has become a reluctant celebrity within the colony while actively working to normalize perceptions of both her condition and Galinstanian sentience.</p>
  <p>As of the events of Book 2, Celectra has completed the academic portion of the colony’s core academic curriculum. She continues her higher education through distance learning at home under Utara’s guidance, majoring in Applied Cognitive Science with a specialization in Neuro-Linguistic & Multiplicity Studies. In addition to her university coursework, she maintains an active schedule of indoor physical pursuits—including dance, swimming, karate, yoga, acrobatics, and gymnastics—to accommodate her extreme photosensitivity.</p>
