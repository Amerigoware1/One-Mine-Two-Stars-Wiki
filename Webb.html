      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Councilor Malcolm Webb is a prominent member of the New Eden Colony Council and the de facto leader of the "Ares-First" faction. A pragmatic expansionist with an engineering background, Webb consistently advocates for prioritizing human needs and colony infrastructure over what he views as excessive accommodation of Galinstanian interests. While often appearing antagonistic toward cross-species cooperation, his positions stem from a genuine concern for colony survival and self-sufficiency.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Political Philosophy & "Ares-First" Faction</h2>
      <p>Webb's political stance is characterized by several core principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Human Priority:</strong> Believes human survival and expansion must come before indigenous rights in conflict situations</li>
        <li><strong>Practical Expansion:</strong> Advocates for fewer restrictions on mining, agriculture, and settlement to ensure colony growth</li>
        <li><strong>Skepticism of Dependence:</strong> Questions reliance on Celectra as the sole bridge, pushing for technological alternatives</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Pragmatism:</strong> Views Galinstanians as potential obstacles to vital resource extraction</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Despite his hardline positions, Webb is not portrayed as villainous—he represents legitimate concerns about colony security and autonomy. His famous quote during a Council debate encapsulates his philosophy: "We came here to build a civilization, not tip-toe around cave dwellers."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Role in Key Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early Council Debates:</strong> Frequently opposed mining restrictions that protected Galinstanian territories</li>
        <li><strong>Northern Disturbance Crisis:</strong> Initially argued against mounting a rescue mission for Dr. Kret, citing resource costs and precedent</li>
        <li><strong>Listener Corps Establishment:</strong> Grudgingly approved the program only after being shown its efficiency benefits</li>
        <li><strong>Technological Bridge Development:</strong> Became a strong advocate for synthetic communication systems to reduce dependence on Celectra</li>
        <li><strong>Kret's Tribunal:</strong> Focused on probation violation aspects rather than ethical concerns about Galinstanian treatment</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Relationships</h2>
      <p>Webb maintains complex professional relationships shaped by his political positions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Celectra Carisco:</strong> Respects her abilities but sees her as a potential single point of failure; their debates are often heated but professional</li>
        <li><strong>Dr. Troy & Amerigo Carisco:</strong> Frequently clashes with science leadership over research priorities and ethical constraints</li>
        <li><strong>Chief Roan:</strong> Works pragmatically with security, valuing her no-nonsense approach to colony protection</li>
        <li><strong>Councilor Santos:</strong> Serves as his primary political counterbalance, often mediating between his faction and more cooperative approaches</li>
        <li><strong>Jaxon Bowers:</strong> Initially dismissive of "Launchlings" but came to respect his engineering contributions to the communication project</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Character Development</h2>
      <p>Throughout the series, Webb exhibits subtle but meaningful evolution:</p>
      <p><strong>Book 1-2:</strong> Presents as the primary antagonist to cross-species cooperation, representing colonialist attitudes.</p>
      <p><strong>Northern Crisis:</strong> Shows pragmatic flexibility when faced with undeniable evidence of Kret's violations and treaty obligations.</p>
      <p><strong>Book 3:</strong> Becomes an unexpected advocate for technological solutions that benefit both species, recognizing that human independence doesn't require Galinstanian exclusion. By Celectra's Ph.D. defense, he attends not as critic but as interested council member.</p>
      <p>His journey reflects the colony's own maturation—from survival-focused expansion to complex interdependence.</p>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Notable Quotes</h2>
      <p>"We came here to build a civilization, not tip-toe around cave dwellers."</p>
      <p>"Every time someone breaks rules, we mount expensive rescue operations? What precedent does this set?"</p>
      <p>"I don't care if it's alien or human—inefficiency is inefficiency. If the girl can train others to do her job, let her. That's just good management."</p>
      <p>"Fine. Adopt their three-part remediation plan. But I want those teenagers as consultants. If they're old enough to find the problem, they're old enough to help fix it."</p>
