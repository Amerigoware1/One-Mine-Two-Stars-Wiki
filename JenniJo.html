      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Jenni Jo Carisco-Bowers is the second-born daughter of Celectra and Jaxon, born May 30, 2247 alongside her identical twin sister Mara Zo. Named after her grandmother Jinan "Jenni" Carisco (Celectra's biological mother), she represents the vibrant, energetic future of New Eden—a child growing up with Galinstanian friends as a normal part of childhood.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Birth and Naming</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Born 20 minutes after her twin sister Mara</li>
        <li>Weighed 2.6kg at birth</li>
        <li>Named by Celectra holding her: "And this one... I was thinking Jenni."</li>
        <li>The name honors Celectra's birth mother who died in childbirth</li>
        <li>The middle name "Jo" is a diminutive of her father Jaxon's name</li>
        <li>Her naming helped Amerigo process grief over his first wife's death</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Personality and Development</h2>
      <p>From infancy, Jenni demonstrates an active, curious, and energetic temperament. She approaches the world with enthusiasm and immediate engagement, contrasting with her more cautious twin.</p>
      
      <p>Notable developmental milestones:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First word at 10.5 months: "Dada"</li>
        <li>Rolling over at 8 weeks (earlier than Mara)</li>
        <li>Walking at 10 months</li>
        <li>By age 1, known for "enthusiastic smashing" of her first birthday cake</li>
        <li>Shows slight preference for Celectra's right body but accepts care from either</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Family Context</h2>
      <p>Jenni grows up in New Eden's most famous family:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mother: Celectra Carisco-Bowers (the bridge between species)</li>
        <li>Father: Jaxon Bowers (engineer who helped develop the technological bridge)</li>
        <li>Twin sister: Mara Zo Carisco-Bowers</li>
        <li>Grandparents: Amerigo and Zoë Carisco</li>
        <li>Uncle: Xan Carisco (inventor of the glockenspiel communication method)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>She is the first human child to have a Galinstanian playmate (Chime) from infancy, representing the normalization of cross-species relationships.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Early Cross-Species Interaction</h2>
      <p>Even before her first birthday, Jenni shows natural comfort with Galinstanians:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>At 6 months: Reaches out to touch Chime, giggles at cool smoothness</li>
        <li>At 1 year: Tries to "grab" Chime playfully during birthday party</li>
        <li>Learning basic tapping code from Xan by age 1</li>
        <li>Will grow up learning Listener Corps techniques as normal education</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Her childhood represents the fulfillment of Celectra's work: a generation for whom communication with Galinstanians is as normal as talking to other humans.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Symbolic Significance</h2>
      <p>Jenni and her sister embody multiple layers of legacy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Healing family grief:</strong> Named after two women who died tragically (Mara Kret and Jinan Carisco)</li>
        <li><strong>Bridge normalization:</strong> First generation for whom Celectra's work is background, not extraordinary</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural integration:</strong> Will attend school with human and Galinstanian "students"</li>
        <li><strong>Future potential:</strong> May develop entirely new forms of cross-species interaction</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As Zoë observes: "These two will face challenges we can't imagine. But they'll have foundation we built. That's what legacy means."</p>
