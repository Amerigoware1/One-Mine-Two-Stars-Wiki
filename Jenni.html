        <h2 id="background" class="section-header gradient-title">Background</h2>
        <p>Jenni Carisco was an exogeologist stationed on Utopis-Lab 3, orbiting the moon Oscar in the Ares system. She discovered she was pregnant during a survey mission, approximately six weeks along, and chose to keep the news secret until she could tell her husband, Amerigo Carisco, in person upon her return. However, a solar mass ejection from the star Niamh caused a propulsion anomaly on the station, exposing the crew—and Jenni—to high levels of radiation. The exposure occurred during the critical early stages of her pregnancy, which was later revealed to involve twins.</p>
        <p>Despite the risks, Jenni carried the pregnancy to term, giving birth to Celectra Carisco—a unique child manifesting as one consciousness in two separate bodies due to the prenatal radiation exposure, which fused the twins' neural development into a shared mind with "Celectricity." Jenni's fate after the birth is implied to involve complications from the radiation, leading to her death, after which Amerigo remarried Zoë Carisco.</p>

        <h2 id="personality" class="section-header gradient-title">Personality and Traits</h2>
        <p>Jenni is depicted as a resilient and determined scientist, facing the uncertainties of her pregnancy and radiation exposure with analytical pragmatism. She prioritizes protecting her unborn child(ren), displaying a protective maternal instinct even in the face of dire medical prognoses. Her scientific background shines through in her methodical approach to crises, calculating risks and outcomes like geological surveys.</p>
        <p>Key traits include:</p>
        <ul class="list-container">
            <li class="list-item">Resilience: Jenni endures the physical and emotional toll of radiation exposure without losing hope.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Protectiveness: She instinctively shields her abdomen during the flare event and commits to monitoring the pregnancy despite poor odds.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Analytical: Approaches her situation with data-driven logic, questioning medical certainties and seeking any possible positive outcomes.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Optimism: Holds onto hope for her child's survival, whispering encouragement to her unborn twins.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To further develop her character, Jenni could be shown in flashbacks as a pioneering explorer, driven by curiosity about extraterrestrial geology, which mirrors the story's themes of discovery and adaptation.</p>

                <h3 class="text-green-700 font-bold">Celectra Carisco (Daughter)</h3>
                <p>As Celectra's birth mother, Jenni's protective actions during the flare directly influence her daughter's unique physiology. Though she does not survive long after the birth, her legacy lives on through Celectra's existence.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 id="development" class="section-header gradient-title">Character Development</h2>
        <p>Jenni's arc centers on her transformation from a professional scientist to a fiercely protective mother facing existential threats. Key moments include:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr class="table-header">
                    <th>Chapter/Event</th>

            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>Prologue</td><td>Discovers her pregnancy and faces radiation exposure during the solar flare, committing to protect her unborn twins.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chapter 7</td><td>Gives birth to Celectra, whose dual-body condition results from the prenatal radiation; Jenni's health deteriorates post-birth.</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Jenni's story emphasizes themes of sacrifice, maternal love, and the unintended consequences of space exploration. Her death paves the way for Amerigo's remarriage to Zoë and the family's expansion.</p>

        <h2 id="trivia" class="section-header gradient-title">Trivia</h2>
        <ul class="list-container">
            <li class="list-item">Jenni's mitochondrial DNA shows unusual repair enzyme expression, which may have mitigated some radiation effects on her and contributed to Celectra's survival.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Her exposure to Niamh's flare is the catalyst for Celectra's "Celectricity," linking her directly to the series' central supernatural element.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Jenni represents the human cost of colonization, highlighting the dangers of living in the Ares system.</li>
