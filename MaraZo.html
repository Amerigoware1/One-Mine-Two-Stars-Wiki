      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Mara Zo Carisco-Bowers is the firstborn daughter of Celectra and Jaxon, born May 30, 2247 alongside her identical twin sister Jenni Jo. Named after her great-grandmother Mara Kret, she represents the next generation of humans growing up in New Eden—a society where human-Galinstanian communication and coexistence are normal aspects of daily life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Birth and Naming</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Born to Celectra's right body after a 14-hour labor</li>
        <li>Weighed 2.8kg at birth</li>
        <li>Named immediately after birth by Celectra: "Mara. First one is Mara."</li>
        <li>The name honors Zoë's mother, Mara Kret, who died in a shuttle accident before the colonists left Earth</li>
        <li>The middle name "Zo" is derived from her grandmother Zoë's name</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Personality and Development</h2>
      <p>Even in infancy, Mara shows a calm and observant temperament. By six months, she demonstrates patience and methodical exploration of her environment. Unlike her more active twin Jenni, Mara tends to carefully examine objects and situations before engaging.</p>
      
      <p>Notable developmental milestones:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First word at 10 months: "Mama" (specifically to Celectra's right body)</li>
        <li>Sitting up independently at 5 months</li>
        <li>Walking at 10 months</li>
        <li>By age 1, developing distinction between Celectra's bodies: calls right body "Mama," left body "Mommy"</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Family Context</h2>
      <p>Mara grows up in an unconventional but loving family structure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mother: Celectra Carisco-Bowers (one consciousness in two bodies)</li>
        <li>Father: Jaxon Bowers</li>
        <li>Twin sister: Jenni Jo Carisco-Bowers</li>
        <li>Grandparents: Amerigo and Zoë Carisco</li>
        <li>Uncle: Xan Carisco</li>
        <li>Extended family includes Uncle Alex and Aunt Dee Cruiz</li>
      </ul>
      <p>She is the first generation to experience a mother with dual bodies as completely normal, and to have Galinstanian friends like Chime as regular playmates.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Genetic Background</h2>
      <p>Genetic screening at 6 months confirmed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No indication of mononous disoma (Celectra's condition was caused by radiation exposure, not inherited)</li>
        <li>Identical twin to Jenni Jo (monozygotic)</li>
        <li>Normal human genetic profile</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unlike her mother, Mara will not develop Celectricity or dual-body consciousness. She represents the "normal" generation that benefits from the bridges her mother built.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>Mara and her sister represent:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first generation born into a fully integrated human-Galinstanian society</li>
        <li>Living proof that Celectra's legacy extends beyond her unique abilities</li>
        <li>The normalization of cross-species relationships</li>
        <li>The future of New Eden colony beyond the "bridge generation"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As Celectra observes in Book 3: "They'll never know what being the only bridge was like. And that's success."</p>
