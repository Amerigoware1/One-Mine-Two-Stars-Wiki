      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Chen Wei is a technically-minded Ares-born colonist who transitions from competitive karate to cross-species communication technology. After losing in the first round of a tournament to an undersized 14-year-old Celectra Carisco when he was 16, he shifted his focus from physical competition to technical fields where size and physiology mattered less. He joined the Listener Corps in Book 2 and by Book 3 works as a technician assisting with the development of technology designed to eventually replace Celectra's biological telepathic bridge.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">Karate Background & Pivotal Loss</h2>
      <p>Chen trained under Sensei Kisa at the Sundome Karate Dojo from a young age:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Disciplined Student:</strong> Known for precise form and technical understanding of martial mechanics</li>
        <li><strong>Tournament Competitor:</strong> Regularly participated in colony tournaments alongside peers like Kai Vasquez, Yuki Sato, and Celectra</li>
        <li><strong>The Defining Loss:</strong> At age 16, he faced 14-year-old Celectra in the first round of a tournament. Despite his technical skill and physical advantage, he lost to her unconventional style and dual-body coordination.</li>
        <li><strong>Shift in Perspective:</strong> The loss prompted him to question physical competition and seek fields where analytical thinking mattered more than physiology</li>
        <li><strong>Sensei Kisa's Influence:</strong> Maintained respect for his teacher but gradually reduced tournament participation after the loss</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Listener Corps Recruitment</h2>
      <p>In Book 2, Chen was among the first recruits for the newly formed Listener Corps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Fascinated by the technical challenge of cross-species communication</li>
        <li><strong>Skills Applied:</strong> His analytical mind and disciplined focus translated well to signal monitoring and protocol development</li>
        <li><strong>Early Role:</strong> Assisted in baseline monitoring of telepathic fields and helped develop early amplification equipment</li>
        <li><strong>Working with Celectra:</strong> Maintained professional respect for her abilities despite their competitive history</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Contributions:</strong> Helped calibrate equipment to distinguish between human neural noise and genuine Galinstanian signals</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Book 3: Technical Development Role</h2>
      <p>By Book 3, Chen works on the urgent project to develop technology that can replace Celectra's deteriorating biological bridge:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Equipment Design:</strong> Helps build and test prototype telepathic field amplifiers and translators</li>
        <li><strong>Calibration Specialist:</strong> Uses his precision mindset to fine-tune sensitive equipment</li>
        <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Monitors Celectra's field degradation patterns to inform technical requirements</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Works alongside Dr. Yuki Chen (no relation) and other medical/technical staff</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> Aware of the timeline—Celectra's field is deteriorating faster than expected</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Personality & Motivation</h2>
      <p><strong>Analytical:</strong> Prefers data and systems over emotional or physical displays.</p>
      <p><strong>Adaptive:</strong> Able to shift careers when he recognized his physical limitations.</p>
      <p><strong>Quietly Determined:</strong> Doesn't seek spotlight but works consistently toward solutions.</p>
      <p><strong>Technical Curiosity:</strong> Genuinely fascinated by the "how" of telepathic communication.</p>
      <p><strong>Respectful:</strong> Maintains professional relationships with former competitors and mentors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>Celectra Carisco:</strong> Former tournament opponent, now technical subject and colleague. Respects her abilities but maintains professional distance.</p>
      <p><strong>Sensei Kisa:</strong> Former teacher; still respects their wisdom but has moved beyond martial arts.</p>
      <p><strong>Kai Vasquez & Yuki Sato:</strong> Former dojo peers; may occasionally cross paths but their paths have diverged.</p>
      <p><strong>Listener Corps Team:</strong> Works collaboratively with other corps members and technical staff.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Yuki Chen:</strong> Professional colleague in monitoring and tech development (no familial relation).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Legacy & Significance</h2>
      <p>Chen represents a colony-born generation finding their place in specialized roles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Career Transition Model:</strong> Shows how colonists can shift from physical to technical roles as colony needs evolve</li>
        <li><strong>Bridge Between Fields:</strong> His martial arts discipline informs his technical precision</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Continuity:</strong> Part of the next generation that will maintain human-Galinstanian relations after Celectra</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Growth:</strong> From competitive disappointment to meaningful technical contribution</li>
        <li><strong>Symbolic Role:</strong> His story mirrors the colony's shift from physical survival to complex technical coexistence</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        "The recruits were diverse: Chen Wei from the karate tournament, now fascinated by cross-species communication..."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "He hadn't expected to lose in the first round—not to someone two years younger and half his size. But her two bodies moved as one in ways the rulebook never covered."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "Signal clarity at 87%. Background neural noise reduced by 12% from last calibration. The amplifiers are working."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "We're not just building equipment. We're building a future that doesn't depend on one person's biology."
