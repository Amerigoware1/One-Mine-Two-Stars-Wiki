      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Councilor Chibuike Okafor is a New Eden Colony Council member who chairs the Athletics Committee and oversees recreation and sports programs. Originally from Lagos, Nigeria, Okafor brings a rigorous, principle-based approach to competition fairness while gradually learning to accommodate exceptional cases like Celectra Carisco. Initially skeptical of allowing Celectra to compete in martial arts tournaments due to her dual-body advantage, he eventually developed respect for her discipline and supported innovative solutions that maintained competitive integrity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Athletics Committee Leadership</h2>
      <p>As Athletics Committee Chair, Okafor is responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Competition Standards:</strong> Ensuring fair play across all colony sports and tournaments</li>
        <li><strong>Youth Development:</strong> Overseeing athletic programs for colony children and teenagers</li>
        <li><strong>Facility Management:</strong> Maintaining the Sundome and other recreational facilities</li>
        <li><strong>Rule Adaptation:</strong> Adjusting Earth sports rules for Ares' 0.9g environment</li>
        <li><strong>Exceptional Cases:</strong> Judging eligibility for athletes with unique physiological conditions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>His approach is characterized by cautious conservatism: "I've watched these young people demonstrate discipline and rigor... No coronal flares, no dead satellite behavior—just consistent stellar work."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">The Celectra Eligibility Debate</h2>
      <p>Okafor's most notable controversy involved Celectra's participation in karate tournaments:</p>
      <p>"Across the dojo, Councilor Okafor was in animated conversation with the Athletics Committee. The debate had consumed three committee meetings over the past month. Celectra had sat through all of them, both bodies rigid with controlled frustration, while adults discussed her body like equipment rather than her."</p>
      <p>Okafor initially opposed Celectra's participation, concerned that her four limbs gave her an unfair advantage. He represents the pragmatic concern: "She has four hands and feet while everyone else has two."</p>
      <p>When Celectra proposed her stillness protocol—competing with only one body active—Okafor "voted yes, though his expression suggested he expected her to fail spectacularly."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Character Development & Evolution</h2>
      <p>Okafor undergoes significant growth through his interactions with Celectra:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial Skepticism:</strong> Views Celectra's physiology as an insurmountable competitive advantage</li>
        <li><strong>Protocol Approval:</strong> Agrees to the stillness compromise but expects failure</li>
        <li><strong>Tournament Observation:</strong> Watches silently as Celectra advances through rounds</li>
        <li><strong>Grudging Respect:</strong> After her silver medal performance: "Impressive discipline. I didn't think you could maintain the stillness protocol for the entire tournament."</li>
        <li><strong>Policy Evolution:</strong> Invites Celectra to "submit a formal proposal about alternating bodies between matches to the Athletics Committee. I'll... consider supporting it."</li>
        <li><strong>Listener Corps Support:</strong> Later advocates for young people like Jaxon and Ananya based on their demonstrated discipline</li>
      </ul>
      <p>His journey from skeptic to respectful supporter illustrates the colony's broader adaptation to unique individuals.</p>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Key Scenes & Dialogue</h2>
      <p><strong>During Eligibility Debates:</strong> "Councilor Okafor was in animated conversation with the Athletics Committee... His expression suggested he expected her to fail spectacularly."</p>
      <p><strong>Tournament Observation:</strong> "From the stands, Councilor Okafor watched, expression unreadable."</p>
      <p><strong>Post-Tournament:</strong> "Councilor Okafor caught her eye. His expression had shifted to something almost approaching grudging respect. 'Impressive discipline,' he said stiffly. 'I didn't think you could maintain the stillness protocol for the entire tournament.'"</p>
      <p><strong>Policy Opening:</strong> "'Submit a formal proposal about alternating bodies between matches to the Athletics Committee. I'll... consider supporting it.' From Okafor, that was practically a standing ovation."</p>
      <p><strong>Listener Corps Endorsement:</strong> "'I've watched these young people demonstrate discipline and rigor in everything from academic coursework to athletic competition. No coronal flares, no dead satellite behavior—just consistent stellar work. I see no reason to doubt their findings here.'"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Professional Relationships</h2>
      <p><strong>Celectra Carisco:</strong> Evolves from skeptical authority figure to respectful councilor who acknowledges her discipline and contributions.</p>
      <p><strong>Sensei Onishi Kisa:</strong> Professional counterpart on Athletics Committee; their debates shape colony sports policy.</p>
      <p><strong>Jaxon Bowers & Ananya Patel:</strong> Comes to respect their work ethic and reliability, endorsing their Listener Corps findings.</p>
      <p><strong>Other Council Members:</strong> Works within the council structure, often taking conservative positions that balance more progressive members.</p>
      <p><strong>Colony Youth:</strong> Takes his role as youth overseer seriously, emphasizing discipline and consistency.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Philosophy & Impact</h2>
      <p>Okafor represents an important perspective in colony governance:</p>
      <p><strong>Principle-Based Governance:</strong> Believes rules should apply equally, with exceptions requiring extraordinary justification</p>
      <p><strong>Merit Over Exception:</strong> Values demonstrated discipline and consistent performance over inherent ability</p>
      <p><strong>Conservative Evolution:</strong> Changes his mind based on evidence and demonstrated commitment rather than ideology</p>
      <p><strong>Youth Investment:</strong> Sees colony youth as its future, demanding high standards while providing opportunities</p>
      <p><strong>Practical Fairness:</strong> Struggles with how to define fairness when competitors have fundamentally different physiologies</p>
      <p>His gradual acceptance of Celectra's participation—and later his endorsement of the Listener Corps youth—shows a leader capable of growth while maintaining principled standards.</p>
