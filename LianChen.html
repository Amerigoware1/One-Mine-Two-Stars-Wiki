      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Agricultural Director Lian Chen is a pragmatic and highly skilled engineer responsible for the water security and agricultural sustainability of the Ares colony. A veteran of two decades on Utopis Station, she sought a new beginning on Mars following the dissolution of her marriage. Her leadership is defined by a fierce commitment to human survival needs, balanced with a growing, if sometimes grudging, acknowledgment of planetary ethics. She is known for her directness, her exceptional grasp of hydrological systems, and her complicated professional history with exogeologist Dr. Yuki Chen.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">Physical Appearance</h2>
      <p>Director Chen is a compact, physically fit woman in her fifties. She carries the efficient posture of a career engineer and station dweller. Her hair is cut short and practically, with streaks of grey. Her expression is often one of focused assessment, and she is rarely seen without a dataslate or stylus in hand. Her attire is strictly utilitarian—standard colony jumpsuits, often with the sleeves rolled up, devoid of personal adornment.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">Key Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Oversight of the colony's freshwater extraction and recycling systems.</li>
        <li>Management of all hydroponic and aeroponic agricultural bays.</li>
        <li>Long-term planning for water resource sustainability.</li>
        <li>Liaising with engineering and geology teams on subsurface construction projects affecting aquifers.</li>
        <li>Balancing colonial resource needs with mandates for minimal planetary impact.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Notable Actions & Decisions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Northern Aquifer Expansion Proposal:</strong> Authored and defended the controversial proposal for a 40% increase in water draw from the northern aquifer system, initiating critical debate on its impact on indigenous Galinstanian life.</li>
        <li><strong>Thermal Signature Compromise:</strong> Engineered a revised pipeline route that achieved the required water volume while preserving most Galinstanian thermal signatures, demonstrating adaptability to xenological concerns.</li>
        <li><strong>Shear Zone Reassessment:</strong> After critique from Dr. Yuki Chen, ordered new fluid-structure interaction simulations on a proposed pipeline route, showcasing her commitment to robust engineering over pride.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="section-header">Personal Life</h2>
      <p>Lian Chen spent twenty years on Utopis Station as a senior hydrological engineer. During this time, she married fellow scientist Dr. Yuki Chen. Their relationship, reportedly built on a foundation of intense intellectual partnership, eventually dissolved. The reasons remain private, but the professional dynamic that survived is one of mutual respect sharpened by a history of personal intimacy; they remain each other's most incisive and unforgiving critics.</p>
      <p>Seeking a clean break and a monumental challenge, she transferred to the fledgling Ares colony. She has immersed herself completely in her work, with the survival of the colony becoming her primary personal investment. Her quarters are spartan, her social circle small, and her reputation is that of a brilliant, solitary figure dedicated to ensuring Mars does not thirst.</p>
