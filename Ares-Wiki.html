    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>Ares is a near-Earth-sized moon orbiting the warm super-Jupiter Chaos in the Niamh-Ciara binary star system. Captured recently in cosmic terms, Ares features a Martian-like appearance with a reddish, iron-oxide-rich surface and supports a breathable but thin 0.8 Atm atmosphere. Its 18-hour days and 0.9 G gravity, driven by a large, fast-spinning core, make it a dynamic world suited for human life with adaptation. The moon hosts the New Eden colony along the Pison River and is home to the unexpected Galinstanian species.</p>

    <h2 id="Physical_Characteristics">Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Ares has a diameter of approximately 6,792 kilometers, with a rugged terrain of reddish plains, craters, and volcanic remnants, reminiscent of Mars. Its surface is marked by four small rivers—Pison, Gihon, Hiddekel, and Euphrates—fed by subsurface aquifers, cutting through the rust-red landscape. The gravity of 0.9 G, slightly less than Earth’s, allows human habitation with minor adjustments, while the rapid 18-hour rotation shapes its day-night cycle and influences its magnetic field.</p>

    <h2 id="Atmosphere_and_Climate">Atmosphere and Climate</h2>
    <p>Ares’ atmosphere measures 0.8 atmospheres, comprising 18-20% oxygen, nitrogen as the dominant gas, and traces of carbon dioxide. This thin air is breathable with adaptation—newcomers may require oxygen support, while native-born children develop enhanced lung capacity. The climate features pale, fractured dawns refracted through Chaos’s storms, with temperatures ranging from -20°C to 26°C, moderated by stellar heat, tidal forces, and internal geothermal activity. Eclipses from the binary stars add dynamic insolation challenges.</p>

    <h2 id="Geology_and_Interior">Geology and Interior</h2>
    <p>Ares’ geology reflects its captured origin, with a basaltic crust and iron-rich regolith. Its standout feature is a large, fast-spinning core, likely molten and metal-rich, generating a strong magnetic field to shield the atmosphere. This core drives the 18-hour day and geothermal heat, sustaining warm caverns with bismuth veins that amplify signals. The rivers originate from aquifers fed by this internal warmth, shaping the moon’s sparse but vital hydrology.</p>

    <h2 id="Orbit_and_System">Orbit and System</h2>
    <p>Ares orbits Chaos, the outermost moon in a system of five (Ares, Bran, Fionn, Maeve, Lugh), with a 45-day period in a stable P-type orbit around the Niamh-Ciara binary (0.15 AU separation). The binary stars—Niamh (G-type, bright) and Ciara (K-type, dim)—orbit their barycenter, providing dual illumination. Chaos, a warm super-Jupiter, exerts tidal forces, while other gas giants (Dagda, Morrigan, Lir) with moons like Oscar (hosting Utopis-Lab 3) and Nuada (Utopis-Lab 2) enrich the system’s complexity.</p>

    <h2 id="Native_Life">Native Life</h2>
    <p>Ares was initially deemed sterile, lacking native carbon-based life. However, the discovery of the Galinstanians—sentient, metal-based beings inhabiting subsurface caverns—challenged this view. These creatures, detailed in the <a href="Galinstanian-wiki.html">Galinstanian article</a>, use bismuth veins for telepathic communication, thriving in the moon’s geothermal environment. No other native life forms have been identified.</p>

    <h2 id="Human_Colonization">Human Colonization</h2>
    <p><a href="New Eden.html">New Eden</a>, a small colony of about 200 souls along the Pison River, represents humanity’s foothold on Ares. Established to study the moon and its resources, the settlement features stone, steel, and glass houses around a council hall, with old modules integrated into the layout. The 0.8 Atm atmosphere requires adaptation—children born here develop larger lungs, while adults use oxygen enrichment. Utopis, a geostationary space station, supports logistics and research.</p>

    <h2 id="Cultural_Significance">Cultural Significance</h2>
    <p>Ares derives its name from its Martian-like terrain, a testament to its reddish, iron-oxide-rich landscape. The moon’s cultural importance stems from its role as a frontier of human resilience, with genetically altered trees and plants—adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations and the lack of traditional seasons—supporting New Eden’s ecosystem. The discovery of the Galinstanians reshapes narratives of exploration, highlighting the moon’s unique geothermal caverns and rivers as symbols of adaptability.</p>
