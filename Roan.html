      <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>Chief Evelyn Roan is the Chief of Security for New Eden Colony and a respected member of the colony council. Professional, methodical, and deeply committed to both safety and justice, she represents the operational backbone of colony governance—where Chief Administrator Santos provides political leadership, Roan provides the practical security that enables the colony to function. Her career has been defined by two major investigations: Dr. Douglas Kret's abuse of Celectra Carisco, and Kret's subsequent torture of Galinstanian beings.</p>
      <p>Initially skeptical of the Galinstanians and the risks of cross-species contact, Roan evolved into one of their strongest advocates after witnessing their trauma firsthand during the northern cluster rescue operation.</p>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Appearance and Demeanor</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age</strong>: Late 40s (as of Book 3)</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation</strong>: Professional, practical, no-nonsense</li>
        <li><strong>Uniform</strong> Functional New Eden security attire—durable fabrics, comms gear, utility belts, but deliberately non-militaristic in design</li>
        <li><strong>Hair</strong>: Practical short style, easy to maintain in field conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Eyes</strong>: Sharp, observant, miss little</li>
        <li><strong>Posture</strong>: Always alert but not tense—economy of movement</li>
        <li><strong>Voice</strong>: Clear, measured, carries authority without shouting</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">Roan's presence commands respect without intimidation. She moves through the colony with quiet competence, her eyes constantly assessing but not threatening. Her security team respects her not because of her rank, but because of her consistent fairness and competence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Background and Early Career</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Born on Earth circa 2180</li>
        <li>Background in civil security and crisis management</li>
        <li>Applied for Ares colonization as part of the security contingent</li>
        <li>Rose through ranks due to competence and clear judgment</li>
        <li>Appointed Chief of Security before the colony's move to Ares surface</li>
        <li>Survived early colony crises that tested her protocols</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">Unlike many colonists who came for scientific or ideological reasons, Roan came with a specific mission: to establish workable security systems for a fragile frontier society. Her philosophy emphasizes prevention, de-escalation, and community-based security over authoritarian control.</p>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">The Kret Investigations</h2>
      
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">First Investigation (Book 1 - 2232)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Led investigation into Dr. Kret's unauthorized experiments on 7-year-old Celectra Carisco</li>
        <li>Documented the Omni-tomography incident and subsequent isolation testing</li>
        <li>Coordinated the search when Celectra fled into the caves</li>
        <li>Arrested Kret while he was searching for Celectra in the cave systems</li>
        <li>Presented evidence at Kret's first tribunal that led to his exile to the survey team</li>
        <li>Initially skeptical of the Galinstanian discovery, but maintained professional neutrality</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Second Investigation (Book 2 - 2239)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Led rescue operation for the northern Galinstanian cluster after Kret's experiments</li>
        <li>Personally witnessed the trauma inflicted on the young Galinstanian</li>
        <li>Kret sabotaged the rescue operation, overloading equipment to cause structural collapse</li>
        <li>Roan and 14 others (including two minors) were trapped underground for 18 hours</li>
        <li>Galinstanian assistance was crucial to their survival and rescue</li>
        <li>This experience transformed her from skeptic to advocate</li>
        <li>Testified at Kret's second tribunal about the sabotage and endangerment</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400 italic">"During extraction, Dr. Kret deliberately sabotaged our rescue operation by overloading his own equipment, causing a catastrophic structural collapse that trapped fifteen people—including two minors—underground for eighteen hours. Only luck and the assistance of the Galinstanian collective prevented multiple casualties." — Chief Roan's tribunal testimony</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Evolution on Galinstanian Relations</h2>
      <p>Roan's journey represents the colony's broader evolution:</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Initial Position (Pre-Contact)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Security-first mentality: unknown intelligence = potential threat</li>
        <li>Advocated for caution and containment protocols</li>
        <li>Concerned about resource allocation to "alien diplomacy"</li>
        <li>Supported limited contact only with strict safety measures</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">The Turning Point (Northern Cluster Rescue)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Witnessed Galinstanian trauma firsthand</li>
        <li>Saw them as victims rather than threats</li>
        <li>Received life-saving assistance from the collective while trapped</li>
        <li>Recognized their capacity for compassion and cooperation</li>
        <li>Began to see security as including Galinstanian well-being</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Current Position (Book 3)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong advocate for Galinstanian protection and rights</li>
        <li>Developed joint security protocols with Galinstanian input</li>
        <li>Views them as partners in colony safety</li>
        <li>Incorporates their unique abilities into security planning</li>
        <li>Balances human security needs with cross-species ethics</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-4">Her transformation is particularly meaningful because it comes from a security professional—not a scientist or idealist. When Roan advocates for Galinstanian protections, the council listens because they know her priority is always practical safety.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Security Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Roan's approach to colony security emphasizes several key principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prevention over reaction</strong>: Extensive planning and protocols to avoid crises</li>
        <li><strong>Community integration</strong>: Security personnel live and work among colonists, not separate</li>
        <li><strong>Proportional response</strong>: Minimum necessary force, maximum de-escalation</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Security operations are documented and reviewable</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptability</strong>: Protocols evolve with colony needs and new challenges</li>
        <li><strong>Justice orientation</strong>: Security serves the colony's ethical standards, not just order</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Notable Protocols Established</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First Contact Protocols</strong>: Revised after northern cluster incident to emphasize non-harm</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Species Security</strong>: Joint human-Galinstanian patrols in sensitive areas</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Response</strong>: Integration of Galinstanian assistance in rescue operations</li>
        <li><strong>Scientific Ethics Oversight</strong>: Security review of high-risk research proposals</li>
        <li><strong>Community Watch</strong>: Colonist participation in security through observation and reporting</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Council Role and Politics</h2>
      <p>As Chief of Security, Roan holds an automatic council seat. Her political stance is characterized by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pragmatism</strong>: Decisions based on practical outcomes, not ideology</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence-based</strong>: Insists on data and investigation before policy</li>
        <li><strong>Coalition builder</strong>: Works with both "Ares-First" (Webb) and "Expansionist" (Troy) factions when security interests align</li>
        <li><strong>Santos ally</strong>: Close working relationship with Chief Administrator Santos, providing the security backbone to Santos's political leadership</li>
        <li><strong>Mediator</strong>: Often helps bridge divides between scientific and practical concerns</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Notable Council Votes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First Contact Committee</strong>: Voted in favor after initial skepticism</li>
        <li><strong>Kret's Tribunals</strong>: Supported both convictions and sentences</li>
        <li><strong>Listener Corps Expansion</strong>: Supported as security enhancement</li>
        <li><strong>Moon Colony Security</strong>: Advocates for robust protocols before expansion</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Allocation</strong>: Balishes security needs with other colony priorities</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Key Relationships</h2>
      
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Chief Administrator Santos</h3>
      <p><strong>"If Ares had a queen, she'd be her."</strong> Roan respects Santos's leadership and provides the security apparatus that makes Santos's governance possible. Their relationship is professional but built on deep mutual respect. Santos trusts Roan's judgment implicitly on security matters.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Dr. Lorain Troy (Former Chief Scientist)</h3>
      <p>Initially clashed over risk assessment but developed respect. Roan appreciated Troy's willingness to incorporate security concerns into scientific planning.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Marcus Webb (Infrastructure Coordinator)</h3>
      <p>Frequent ally on practical matters, though sometimes at odds on Galinstanian relations. Respects Webb's focus on colony infrastructure but challenges his dismissiveness toward non-human interests.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Celectra Carisco</h3>
      <p>Professional relationship that became protective. Roan sees Celectra as both a unique asset to the colony and someone who has suffered under inadequate protection. Her investigations of Kret were partly motivated by ensuring Celectra's safety.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Galinstanian Collective</h3>
      <p>Evolved from viewing them as security concerns to seeing them as security partners. Particularly respects their ability to monitor geological stability and assist in search/rescue operations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Personal Life</h2>
      <p>Roan maintains a deliberate separation between her professional and personal lives, though in a small colony complete separation is impossible:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Residence</strong>: Modest quarters near security headquarters</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships</strong>: No public partnerships; maintains privacy about personal life</li>
        <li><strong>Hobbies</strong>: Maintains a small hydroponic garden (rare personal indulgence)</li>
        <li><strong>Community involvement</strong>: Teaches self-defense and crisis response classes to colonists</li>
        <li><strong>Work-life balance</strong>: Strict about off-duty time for herself and her team</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">Her personal quarters are notably sparse but orderly, with few decorations beyond a small collection of Earth minerals and efficient growing lights for her plants. Colonists know not to disturb her during off-hours unless absolutely necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-bg">
      <h2 class="section-header">Legacy and Impact</h2>
      <p>Chief Roan's contributions to New Eden Colony include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Security Infrastructure</strong>: Established protocols that have prevented major crises</li>
        <li><strong>Justice System</strong>: Investigative rigor that ensured accountability (Kret cases)</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Species Integration</strong>: Pioneered security cooperation with Galinstanians</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Standards</strong>: Set expectations for security conduct that emphasize ethics</li>
        <li><strong>Crisis Response</strong>: Led successful operations under extreme conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Mentorship</strong>: Trained next generation of security personnel</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="mt-4">Perhaps her most significant legacy is demonstrating that security and compassion are not opposites—that the safest colony is also the most just one, and that protecting the vulnerable (human or otherwise) is central to true security.</p>
